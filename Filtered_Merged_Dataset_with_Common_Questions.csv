0,135105,"stripped - envelope supernovae ( sne ) , i.e. core - collapse sne that have lost their hydrogen envelope , and retained ( type ib ) or lost ( type ic ) their helium envelope , are the progeny of massive stars @xcite .
their light curves @xcite and spectra @xcite display significant diversity , owing to the many different parameters of the exploding stellar cores ( masses , rotation rates , metallicity , multiplicity ) , and possibly to the different degree of asphericity of the explosion @xcite .
type ic sne characterized by broad absorption lines or high photospheric velocities ( @xmath315000 - 20000 km s@xmath5 at maximum luminosity ) , and hence high kinetic energies ( @xmath6 erg ) , accompany the majority of long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ; woosley & bloom 2006 ) .
this points to the presence of an extra source of energy , besides radioactive @xmath1ni , i.e. a rotating , and possibly accreting , inner compact remnant .
this  engine "" may play a role also in @xmath35% of all detected sne ic with high photospheric velocities , that are however not accompanied by grbs @xcite .
this heterogeneous phenomenology needs to be mapped onto the properties of the progenitors and the explosions , and the intrinsic physical effects must be distinguished from those generated by differences in the viewing angle toward the explosion symmetry axis .
therefore , it is important to observe these sne accurately and to build a complete physical scenario .
optical multi - colour searches with very large field - of - view cameras and high cadence are ideal to detect a large number of core - collapse sne , that are rather common , but often faint and buried in their host galaxy s starlight . during the wide field
optical searches of the huge sky localization uncertainty area of the gravitational wave candidate detected by the advanced ligo interferometers ( aligo ; abbott et al .
2016 ) on 22 october 2015 ( called g194575 , * ? ? ?

* ) , many multi - wavelength transients were detected that are unrelated with the event ( see corsi et al .
2016 ; palliyaguru et al .
2016 , and references therein ) , a fraction of which were spectroscopically classified . among these
is iptf15dld .
sn iptf15dld was detected @xcite by the 48inch oschin telescope at mount palomar during the intermediate palomar transient factory ( ptf ) survey @xcite on 23 october , 08:15 ut at coordinates ra = 00:58:13.28 , dec = -03:39:50.3 with a magnitude of 18.50 ( mould @xmath7 filter , ab system , * ? ? ?
the initial identification as a seyfert 2 galaxy at @xmath8 @xcite , based on a preliminary spectral analysis , was later revised to the classification as a broad - lined type ic sn @xcite .
we here very slightly revise the redshift to @xmath0 based on accurate analysis of the host galaxy emission lines .
this corresponds to a distance of 200 mpc using @xmath9 km  s@xmath5  mpc@xmath5 @xcite , and a flat cosmology with @xmath10 @xcite .
the galactic extinction along the sn line of sight is @xmath11 mag @xcite .
the sn was also independently discovered as lsq15bfp on 5 october 2015 with @xmath12 mag during the la silla quest survey ( lsq , * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
* ) by @xcite who also report a pre - discovery detection on 3 october 2015 at @xmath13 mag and a brightening of 0.7 mag in 2 days suggesting that this date must be very close to explosion time .
the object was also detected by pan - starrs as ps15crl in 6 separate exposures on 23 october 2015 ( see smartt et al .
2016 , and huber et al .
2015 for a description of the current pan - starrs surveys ) .
the pan - starrs reference images show a very blue starburst region that is superimposed on a larger spiral galaxy .
@xcite , who reported early optical photometry and a spectrum on 7 november 2015 , detected no significant x - ray or radio emission for this sn ( see also evans et al . 2015 ; 2016 ) .    here
we present the _
swift_/uvot and ground - based optical observations of the sn , including those preliminarily reported in @xcite and @xcite , and additional spectra acquired within the pessto program @xcite .
we adopt 3 october 2015 as the date of explosion , with an uncertainty of one day .
optical photometry and spectroscopy of the sn were acquired at the 1.82 m _ copernico _ telescope at cima ekar ( asiago , italy ) , at the telescopio nazionale galileo ( tng ) , nordic optical telescope ( not ) and liverpool telescope ( lt , steele et al .
2004 ) at the canary islands ( spain ) , at the eso ntt and 1 m schmidt telescope as part of the pessto and lsq surveys , respectively .
uv photometry was taken with the uvot instrument onboard the _ swift _ satellite .
the logs of optical photometric and spectroscopic observations are reported in tables [ tab : gb_obs_phot ] and [ tab : gb_obs_spec ] , respectively .
the exposure times were typically 5 - 10 minutes for the photometry and 20 - 40 min for spectroscopy .
these data were reduced following standard tasks within the iraf reduction package .      the @xmath14-band image of the sn field obtained at the _ copernico _ telescope is presented in figure  [ fig : snfield ] .
the sn exploded in the outskirts of a spiral galaxy , in a starburst region that is marginally resolved both in our and in the sdss images ( @xmath15 angular size ) and contaminates dramatically the measurements of the sn in the bluer bands ( see sect .
[ res : hostgalaxy ] ) .    given the complex background , the sn magnitudes were measured via template subtraction . for this purpose
we used the snoopy package developed by one of us ( e. cappellaro ) : this is a collection of python scripts based on publicly available tools .
in particular , for template subtraction we used the  hotpants "" package . for the lsq observations we used images of the field taken by the lsq in 2012 as subtraction templates ; while for the _ ugriz _ photometry we used sdss images , which provide a solid estimate of the pre - explosion background .
sn magnitudes in the template - subtracted images were measured by psf fitting .
we found psf fitting is less sensitive to background fluctuations compared with standard aperture photometry .
the lsq images are unfiltered , but close to the @xmath14 filter , therefore the magnitudes resulting from the photometry were converted to this band using a calibrating sequence of field stars .
starting on 6.97 november 2015 , ut and ending on 7.43 november 2015 , ut the _ swift _ satellite observed the target ( see observing log in table  [ tab : uvotobs ] ) .
the uvot camera measurements in the optical and uv were reduced according to brown et al .
( 2015 ) and calibrated following poole et al .
( 2008 ) and breeveld et al .
aperture photometry with a radius of @xmath16 with background estimated from a nearby sky area yielded the magnitudes reported in table  [ tab : uvotobs ] .

flux calibration was derived from observations of spectrophotometric standard stars obtained , when possible , on the same night as the sn .
corrections for the telluric absorption bands were derived using telluric standards . in some cases ,
non - perfect removal can affect the sn features that overlap with the strongest atmospheric features , in particular with the telluric o2 a band at 7590 - 7650  .    in order to subtract the starburst contribution from the sn spectra
, we used the template spectra of star - forming galaxies by @xcite .
the best fitting template was chosen by matching the colours of the starburst region as measured on the pre - explosion sdss images ( table [ tab : hostgalaxy ] ) : this indicated a preference for a template with moderate intrinsic absorption ( @xmath55 , kinney et al .
1996 ) , as independently indicated also by the uvot detections in the uv filters .
the spectral template was fitted with a low order polynomial ( to reduce noise in subtraction ) ; the relative contributions of the starburst and sn components were then determined based on the starburst archival magnitudes and on the template - subtracted sn photometry simultaneous with the spectra , respectively .
finally , the template was reduced to the sn redshift and subtracted from the sn spectra in rest - frame . with this procedure
the spectra show some variation in the residual continuum of the blue spectral region , which we attribute to uncertainties in the flux calibration .
we allowed for a small adjustment in the template continuum slope ( corresponding to @xmath560.1 mag variation in @xmath57 ) to ensure all spectra show a similar overall continuum .

the sn is hosted by a compact starburst galaxy / region that , in turn , appears projected over the disc of a spiral galaxy .
the narrow emission lines we detected in our spectra ( see sect . [
res : spectra ] ) indicate that the two objects , starburst and spiral galaxy , are located at the same redshift , although we can not assess whether they form a unique structure or a galaxy pair .
the starburst nucleus is a luminous uv source which was detected by galex on 8 october 2008 ( galex source j005813.0 - 033946 ) with ab magnitudes fuv = 18.89 , and nuv = 18.38 , ( kron aperture ; note that the nuv band , @xmath32300  , is similar to the uvm2 band of _
swift_/uvot ) .
the sdss magnitudes of the starburst region at the location of the sn are reported in table [ tab : hostgalaxy ] .
note that the half - magnitude offset in the measurements obtained with different photometric apertures does not affect significantly the colours .
the @xmath61-band magnitude obtained with the @xmath16 radius aperture , @xmath65 mag , is consistent with the ab magnitude measured by uvot in the u - band ( table [ tab : uvotobs ] ) .
this and the lack of uv flux variability suggest that the source detected by uvot is dominated by the emission of the starburst region , so that the uv emission of the sn is undetectable . at a distance of 200 mpc , the starburst component has an absolute magnitude in @xmath66-band of -18.5 mag , which places it at the bright end of the blue compact dwarf luminosity function @xcite .
figure [ fig : hostgalpopsynth ] shows a stellar population synthesis model to estimate the age of the stellar population in the vicinity of the sn from the observed colours @xcite .
the model assumes solar metallicity and ages comprised between 1 and 500 myr . by correcting the starburst
colours  adopting the circumstellar large magellanic cloud extinction law of @xcite as in @xcite  for moderate values of intrinsic extinction ( from null to @xmath67 , i.e. somewhat higher than the maximum intrinsic extinction of the assumed star - forming galaxy template , @xmath68 ) , in addition to the galactic one ( @xmath69 ) , we obtain the intrinsic colours reported in figure [ fig : hostgalpopsynth ] as filled blue squares .
the colour resulting from maximum correction is consistent with a population age of 10 myr , which corresponds to the evolution time of a 20 m@xmath2 star .
the use of an extinction curve more suitable for hot stars @xcite leads to a similar conclusion .
this satisfactory match indicates the presence of a young massive star population , consistent with the explosion of a massive stellar core that has evolved from a main sequence mass of @xmath320 m@xmath2 ( see section [ sect : discussion ] ) .
we note that a milky way extinction curve only provides a match with the starburst colors if the intrinsic extinction is as high as @xmath57 = 0.8 , which is inconsistent with the observed colours of the starburst and indicates that this region presents the characteristics of a more rapidly star - forming , lower metallicity , less evolved environment than our galaxy .
in fact , the star - formation rate of @xmath31  m@xmath2  yr@xmath5 derived by @xcite from radio excess detection within a region a few kpc across , spatially compatible with the uvot source , points to an explosion site of high star formation rate per unit mass .
this is typical for stripped - envelope sne @xcite , expected to be predominantly associated with bright regions of massive and rapid star formation , which could make their detection systematically more arduous at large distances even with the biggest telescopes .

( 2010 ; see their table 1 ) . for maximum extinction ( @xmath57 = 0.377 mag ) , the starburst is compatible with an age of 10 myr , equivalent to the lifetime of a 20 m@xmath2 star . ]      the @xmath14- and @xmath71-band magnitudes of the point - like sn source , derived with psf fitting from the background - subtracted images ( see section [ data : photred ] ) , are reported in table  [ tab : gb_obs_phot ] and , after correction for galactic absorption ( using @xmath11 , schlafly & finkbeiner 2011 , and the extinction curve of cardelli , clayton & mathis 1989 ) , in figure  [ fig : snlcs ] .
we have not corrected for intrinsic extinction within the starburst region because we can not estimate how much this influences the sn emission ( it depends on the relative position of the sn and starburst with respect to the observer ) and we have no evidence that iptf15dld is significantly absorbed in its rest - frame .
in fact , its @xmath73 color , computed from the @xmath14- and @xmath71-band light curves , is comparable to that of well - monitored sne ic close to maximum luminosity @xcite , and possibly bluer at later times , likely owing to significant background still affecting the weaker @xmath14-band flux .
no detection of iptf15dld was obtained with the @xmath74 filters in individual exposures .
the magnitudes from the co - added exposures in these filters are consistent with the sdss measurements .
the @xmath14- and @xmath71-band light curves of iptf15dld were compared with those of sn  2007gr , a type ic sn of  classical "" spectral appearance , i.e. with no broad absorption lines @xcite . at @xmath0 ,
the central wavelengths of the @xmath14- and @xmath71-band filters correspond to 5980    and 7328  , respectively . from the @xmath75 light curves of sn
2007gr we have constructed template light curves at those two reference wavelengths and reported them in figure [ fig : snlcs ] , after brightening the template at 5980   by 0.7 magnitudes . with the exception of the first @xmath71-band point , which is significantly brighter , the match with the templates is generally satisfactory , and it indicates that iptf15dld is a factor of @xmath32 brighter at @xmath36000   and therefore bluer than sn  2007gr in the 6000 - 8000   range .
although the available photometry ( @xmath14- and @xmath71-band only ) is not sufficient to construct a proper pseudo - bolometric light curve , the total spectral flux is a rough proxy of the bolometric behavior . for each spectrum , we integrated the flux - calibrated , dereddened spectral signal in the rest - frame , approximately corresponding to the range 3800 - 7800    ( see fig .
[ fig : spectra ] ) and obtained a bolometric light curve that is similar in shape to those of the faintest stripped - envelope sne that were monitored long enough to allow a comparison with iptf15dld ( sne 1994i , 2002ap ) and in particular to that of sn  2007gr ( see hunter et al .
2009 ) . since our pseudo - bolometric estimate does not include the near - uv and near - infrared contributions , we have estimated this using other sne ic that have good photometric coverage in these bands simultaneous with the optical . at epochs comparable to those of the iptf15dld photometry , the near - uv and near - infrared fluxes of type sne ic combined represent about 40 - 50% of the total flux in 3000 - 24000    ( e.g. sn  1998bw , patat et al . 2001 ; sn  2004aw , taubenberger et al .
2006 ; sn  2007gr , hunter et al .
2009 ) . even taking this into account , iptf15dld is still less luminous than the average of stripped - envelope sne ( fig .

-band ( red circles ) and @xmath71-band ( brown circles ) , corrected for galactic extinction ( @xmath11 ) . at @xmath0 , the central wavelengths of these bands correspond to 5980   and 7328  , respectively .
the time origin corresponds to the maximum of the @xmath14-band light curve . for comparison , we overlaid the light curves of the type ic sn  2007gr at identical reference wavelengths ( dashed curves ; see text for the construction of these templates ) .
the  @xmath14-band ""-
equivalent template of sn  2007gr was brightened by 0.7 magnitudes for best match with iptf15dld . ]
the two spectra taken at the 1.82 m _ copernico _ telescope on 16 and 18 november 2015 were averaged , owing to their closeness in time and similarity , and so were the two spectra acquired at the lt with sprat on 17 and 18 december 2015 .
six final spectra , corrected for galactic extinction and redshift , are reported in figure  [ fig : spectra ] .
the sprat spectrum of november 6 was not shown because it is very close in time to the tng spectrum and of lower signal - to - noise ratio .
the starburst dominates the spectral emission with a blue continuum and narrow emission lines .
however , when its contribution is removed ( see section [ data : specred ] ) , the broad lines typical of sne ic become visible in the visual / red spectral regions . no hydrogen nor helium absorption lines
are seen , indicating a high degree of envelope stripping and leading to type ic classification of the sn .
the narrow emission lines from the underlying starburst region were removed .    in search of a close spectral analogue of iptf15dld
, we compared its spectra with those of eight type ic sne , both broad- and narrow - lined ( sn  1994i , filippenko et al . 1995 ; richmond et al .
1996 ; millard et al .
1999 ; sn  1997ef , iwamoto et al .

2006 ; sn  2007gr , hunter et al .
2009 ) . with the partial aid of a @xmath76-minimization routine we selected the spectra of our sn templates that best - matched , in the 4000 - 7500   wavelength range , those of iptf15dld at comparable phases after light curve maximum .
sne 1998bw and 2006aj , that were associated with grbs @xcite , do not compare well with iptf15dld because their spectra have significantly broader absorption lines ( although in the case of sn2006aj only one spectrum overlaps in phase ) . on the other hand , the classical sne 1994i and 2007gr represent an equally unsatisfactory match because they have narrower lines than our target .
the first four spectra of iptf15dld are more similar to those of sne 1997ef , 2002ap , 2003jd and 2004aw , that are broad - lined ic sne with no accompanying grb ( see also corsi et al .
these have kinetic energies higher than seen on average in sne ic , although they are not as massive nor as luminous as grb sne .
the last spectra ( december 2015 ) resemble both broad- and narrow - lined ic sn spectra , presumably because they are more noisy and at those epochs ( @xmath350 - 60 rest - frame days after maximum ) , the photospheric velocities have significantly decreased also in broad - lined sne . in fig .
[ fig : psc1 ] and [ fig : psc2 ] we show two examples of spectral comparison .
while the signal - to - noise ratio of the spectra and the partial blending of absorption lines , due to their width , makes it difficult to isolate the chemical species and measure their associated velocities , the similarity with broad - lined sne suggests higher - than - normal photospheric velocities .        ) , smoothed with a boxcar of 50   and arbitrarily scaled in flux .
the phases are given in rest - frame , with respect to maximum luminosity .
]     compared with those of sn  1997ef ( red ) and sn  1998bw ( blue ) at comparable rest - frame phases .
the spectrum of sn  1998bw was dereddened with @xmath77 , while that of sn  1997ef needs no absorption correction .
all spectra were smoothed with a boxcar of 50  .
the absorption lines of sn  1998bw are significantly broader than those of iptf15dld , while those of sn  1997ef represent a better match . ]     compared with that of sn  2003jd ( red ) at comparable rest - frame phase , dereddened with @xmath78 .
all spectra were smoothed with a boxcar of 50  . ]
the light curve of iptf15dld resembles that of normal , narrow - lined type ic sne , with sn  2007gr ( hunter et al . 2009 ) providing an excellent match ( fig .
[ fig : snlcs ] ) .
however , the photospheric absorption lines are broad , so this is classified as a broad - lined ic sn , rather similar to well - monitored broad - lined sne ic at comparable epochs after light maximum ( sne 1997ef , 2002ap , 2003jd , 2004aw ) .
since spectra were taken only starting 20 days after maximum , we can not make an assessment of the photospheric velocity before and around maximum ; similarly , the photometric information does not allow us to construct a pseudo - bolometric light curve covering the epoch of maximum luminosity . as a consequence , our estimates of the physical parameters are only approximated .    in absence of synthetic light curve and spectra based on a detailed radiative transfer model obtained from observed quantities ,
the basic sn physical parameters can be derived by rescaling those of other well studied sne using the fundamental relationships of @xcite , as done for instance in @xcite .
however , iptf15dld lacks an estimate of both its light curve width , @xmath79 , and its photospheric velocity at maximum luminosity , @xmath80 .
therefore , our estimate of its kinetic energy and ejecta mass can only be based on an average of these parameters for the five sne that provide the best light curve and spectral match ( see section [ res : spectra ] ) .    from the physical parameters estimated for sne 1997ef , 2002ap , 2003jd , 2004aw and 2007gr ,
@xcite we derive ranges of [ 1 - 18 ] @xmath81 erg and [ 2 - 10 ] m@xmath2 for the kinetic energy and ejecta mass of iptf15dld , respectively .
since the shape and luminosity of the bolometric light curve suggest that iptf15dld could have been similar to sn  2007gr or up to a factor of 2 more luminous at peak , we accordingly estimate that the mass of radioactive @xmath1ni synthesized in the explosion may be in the interval [ 0.08 - 0.2 ] m@xmath2 .
these values are consistent with a progenitor of main sequence mass of the order of @xmath320 - 25 m@xmath2 .
a dedicated accurate model is not completely justified by the limited quality of these data .
broad - lined ic sne of modest luminosity are a rather uncommon and poorly known class , and have started to be detected in larger numbers thanks to dedicated surveys .
as grb sne , that are significantly more massive and luminous , they may be partially powered by an inner engine , i.e. an unusual type of remnant , like a magnetar or a black hole .
the prototype of this sub - class is sn  2002ap @xcite , for which evidence had been found of a small fraction of ejected material accelerated to velocities larger than 30000 km  s@xmath5 . since these objects have low ejecta mass ( their synthesized @xmath1ni mass is small ) , the total kinetic energy is also not extremely large ( @xmath82 erg ) , but the high photospheric velocities suggest a powerful engine . whether these are the progenitors of grbs that are misaligned with respect to the line of sight and therefore go undetected , or they represent a population of intermediate properties between classical , narrow - lined sne ic and grb sne , is matter of controversy @xcite .
clarification of this issue ( e.g. , through late - epoch radio observations , * ? ? ?
* ) may lead to a simplification of the apparent diversity of stripped - envelope sne .
we note that the opposite , i.e. low photospheric velocities in highly luminous sne are never observed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?
the case of iptf15dld shows how optical surveys that cover large areas of the sky with good cadence using classical facilities can improve dramatically the study of a broad range of transients .
early detection and decent monitoring of objects with a variety of properties will fill gaps present in the current information and unify seemingly different phenomena .

 spectra were taken starting 20 rest - frame days after maximum luminosity and are affected by a young stellar population background . 
 broad spectral absorption lines associated with the sn are detected over the continuum , similar to those measured for broad - lined , highly energetic sne ic . 
 the light curve and maximum luminosity are instead more similar to those of low luminosity , narrow - lined ic sne . 
 this suggests a behavior whereby certain highly - stripped - envelope sne do not produce a large amount of @xmath1ni , but the explosion is sufficiently energetic that a large fraction of the ejecta is accelerated to higher - than - usual velocities . 
 we estimate sn iptf15dld had a main sequence progenitor of 20 - 25 m@xmath2 , produced a @xmath1ni mass of @xmath30.1 - 0.2 m@xmath2 , had an ejecta mass of [ 2 - 10 ] m@xmath2 , and a kinetic energy of [ 1 - 18 ] @xmath4 erg .

acknowledgements",How do stripped-envelope supernovae contribute to the synthesis of heavy elements in the universe?,"Stripped-envelope supernovae result from massive stars that lose their outer layers of hydrogen and helium before exploding. These explosions enrich the universe with elements like oxygen, silicon, and iron, which are vital for planet formation and life."," stripped-envelope supernovae contribute to the synthesis of heavy elements in the universe through their ability to produce highly radioactive nuclei that can undergo alpha decay and other nuclear reactions. These heavy elements are then incorporated into the star's crust and mantle, where they are further subjected to nuclear fusion processes to form heavier elements such as gold, platinum, and uranium. The supernova's intense energy output drives the nuclear reactions, which release vast amounts of energy that can be used to fuel the star's core and sustain it for billions of years. Additionally, the supernova's shock wave can compress the star's interior, allowing more nuclear reactions to occur, and the supernova's high-energy photons can also interact with the star's magnetic field, further accelerating the nuclear reactions. Overall, stripped-envelope supernovae play a crucial role in the formation of the heavy elements in the universe by providing the energy and conditions necessary for nuclear fusion to occur.<|im_end|>"," Supernovae with stripped envelopes can contribute to the synthesis of heavy elements in the universe through several mechanisms. These include the release of heavy elements into interstellar space as they explode, which then mixes with other materials and eventually forms stars. The stripped envelope, consisting of a thin layer of material that separates the core of the supernova from its outer layers, can act as a barrier against some types of radiation, such as high-energy gamma rays, which can damage the core of the supernova before it explodes. This prevents the core from being completely destroyed during the explosion, allowing it to continue to burn and release more energy. Additionally, the stripped envelope may also serve as a shield against some types of cosmic rays, which can further protect the core from destruction. The intense energy output of the supernova, combined with the stripping process, can also provide the necessary conditions for the formation of heavy elements in the universe. Overall, stripped-envelope supernovae are thought to play a crucial role in the synthesis"
9,59705,"the _ herschel _ space observatory  @xcite with its 3.5 m telescope provided an excellent platform for fir observations with unprecedented sensitivity , photometric accuracy and spatial resolution .
the fir instrument pacs  @xcite employed the largest detector arrays  @xcite ever flown in space .
its bolometer arrays needed to be cooled to an operational temperature of 285mk , which was achieved by means of a @xmath0he sorption cooler inside the instrument .
we give a short overview of this type of device , which was also used for the spire  @xcite instrument , the recycling process and the characterization of the cooler hold time , which was an essential parameter for the _ herschel _ scientific mission planning .
we present a statistics and characteristics of all pacs cooler cycles over the entire _ herschel _ mission .
finally we sketch a method utilizing the thermal interaction of the sorption cooler pump and the @xmath1he coolant in the _ herschel _ cryostat , by dumping a constant heat input , for determining the remaining liquid @xmath1he mass and hence its lifetime .
the _ herschel _ flight model cooler is described in detail in  @xcite .
[ fig : pacs_cooler ] gives a 3d view of the device showing its main components .    .
, title=""fig:"",scaledwidth=100.0% ] .
, title=""fig:"",scaledwidth=100.0% ]    the evaporator contains a porous material , an alumina sponge ( 91% al@xmath2o@xmath3 / 9% sio@xmath2 ) , which traps the liquid @xmath0he during the cold state .
this liquid @xmath0he evaporates providing the cooling to the detector focal plane .
when all the liquid @xmath0he has been evaporated into the gas phase , it needs to be recycled .
the gaseous @xmath0he flows into the sorption pump which contains active * charcoal * for adsorption of the gas .
[ fig : cooler_schematic ] provides a schematic view of the pacs cooler elements and their thermal connection to the bolometer detector focal plane unit and the liquid @xmath1he bath of the _ herschel _ cryostat , also referred to as the level 0 of the thermal system , l0 , at @xmath41.7k .
he l0 bath of the herschel cryostat at @xmath41.7k .
, scaledwidth=60.0% ]    fig .
[ fig : recycling_temperatures ] shows the evolution of the temperatures relevant for the cooler during the different steps of the recycling process as monitored via housekeeping ( hk ) parameters from temperature sensors . at the beginning ,
the evaporator temperature ( temp_ev ) is around 2k indicating that the cooler has run out of liquid coolant .
the recycling procedure is completely controlled via heaters and heat switches integrated in the cooler .
the heat switches are of the gas - gap type , where the presence or absence of gas between two interlocked copper parts changes drastically the heat flow between them .
gas handling is achieved with a miniature cryogenic adsorption pump ( @xcite ) .
the first 15  minutes serve to settle the thermal environment .
the pump heat switch ( hsp in fig .
[ fig : cooler_schematic ] ) has to be open , so that the pump does not dissipate heat into the instrument .
the evaporator heat switch ( hse in fig .
[ fig : cooler_schematic ] ) is closed so that the evaporator thermalizes with the 2k level and does not warm up too much when the pump is heated and thus still traps condensing gas .
the heat switches hsp and hse are closed by applying a current and opened by setting the current to zero .
the recycling proper starts with heating the sorption pump ( sp ) to desorb the gas that has been trapped in the active charcoal .
after 35min the heater current is lowered to keep the pump at the required temperature of about 40k . at this time @xmath0he out - gases from the pump and condenses .
temp_ev rises following the temperature rise of the pump both because the enthalpy of the hot gas coming from the pump is not fully removed by the thermal shunt and due to the latent heat of @xmath0he .
since the evaporator and the shunt are connected to the same thermal strap , all variations happening at the shunt are also registered by the evaporator temperature sensor ( temp_ev ) .
temp_ev decreases when the pump is kept at the required temperature . at
around 80min temp_ev drops below the 2k level .
the finally achieved temp_ev in this step characterizes the efficiency of the recycling .
after 82min the evaporator heat switch ( hse in fig .
[ fig : cooler_schematic ] ) is opened ( hse = 0ma ) to thermally isolate the evaporator . to establish the cooling functionality the pump heater
is switched off after 94 min and the pump is re - connected to the 2k level by closing the pump switch ( hsp in fig .
[ fig : cooler_schematic ] ) .
once the pump is connected to the 2k level the charcoal in the pump starts pumping and the @xmath0he pressure drops .
the thermally insulated liquid @xmath0he decreases in temperature to below the 300mk level which is reached after around 142min .
the cooler recycling procedure with the tuned time steps as described above proceeded fully automatically .
the duration of the pacs - only cooler recycling block was 142.37min , the duration of the parallel mode cooler recycling block 172.53min .
this automatic cooler recycling procedure implemented by means of the _ herschel _ common uplink system ( cus ) is documented in the online appendix section  [ sec : cooler_cus ] .
the _ herschel _ space observatory executed its observations autonomously along a mission timeline ( mtl ) stored on - board , while ground contact was only during the normally 3h long daily telecommunication period ( dtcp ) .
the mission was divided into operational days ( ods ) of on average approximately 24h duration , each beginning with a dtcp during which the mtl for a forth - coming od was uploaded .
this pre - planned automatic command execution without the possibility of human intervention meant that a reliable prediction of the cooler hold time for pacs photometer operations was necessary .
the cooler hold time was defined as the period between temp_ev going below 300mk at the end of the recycling process ( cf .
[ sec : cooler_recycling ] and fig .
[ fig : recycling_temperatures ] ) and temp_ev exceeding 320mk when liquid helium in the cooler was exhausted .
the essential parameter determining the length of the cooler hold time was the time when the pacs bolometer detectors were biased for measurement .
this period was set by the so - called orbit prologue and orbit epilogue , engineering - type astronomical observations requests ( aors ) setting and resetting the detector bias and bracketing the sequence of science aors .
the so - called biased time was defined as the period between the start of an orbit prologue and the end of the subsequent orbit epilogue .
note , that several biased periods were possible during one single cooler hold time and the biased time quoted in table  [ tab : cooler_statistics_1 ] is the sum of all periods . from od128 onwards ,
the final optimum bias voltages of the pacs detectors were always applied , but on earlier ods of the performance verification and commissioning phases bias settings were varied during detector characterization and optimization periods , which can have some impact on the resulting hold time .    .
different symbols and colors represent pacs only or parallel mode cooler recyclings and the start conditions from a warm , i.e.  exhausted liquid @xmath0he , or a cold , i.e. still available liquid @xmath0he , cooler .
, scaledwidth=100.0% ]    such a dependence was monitored right from the beginning of the mission and after about three quarters of a year there was enough statistics to derive a relation as shown in fig .
[ fig : holdtime_relation ] .
the relation + @xmath5 + established from all complete cooler periods up to od270 , irrespective of the start conditions or whether it was a pacs only or parallel mode cooler recycling , was reliably used in the scientific mission scheduling until the end of the mission with a last pacs cooler recycling on od1443 .
the formula was applied for determination of the cooler hold time following both a pacs only and a parallel mode ( together with the spire cooler ) recycling .    in eqn.(1 )
t@xmath6 can be written as @xmath7 with t@xmath8 being the fraction of the hold time period with the pacs bolometer detectors not biased , e.g.  during spacecraft operational maintenance windows or spire only operations in parallel mode .    in case t@xmath90 , then eqn.(1 ) can be re - written as + @xmath10 + this meant that a contiguous block of about 2.5ods of photometer observations could be scheduled , thus minimizing the cooler recycling frequency .
the remaining 0.5od was usually filled with pacs spectrometer observations , not requiring @xmath0he cooling , by switching between the two pacs sub - instruments .    since the cooler hold time relation in eqn.(1 )
was determined for the point in time when the evaporator temperature exceeded an out - of - limit value of 320mk , a safety time buffer was included when using this relation for mission planning , thus reducing t@xmath11 by t@xmath12 . since the evaporator temperature increased very steeply only at the end of the cooler
hold time ( see fig .
[ fig : cooler_cycles ] ) , a buffer of 1.5h was deemed sufficient initially .
however , inspection of photometer calibration observations , scheduled deliberately at the end of the cooler period for cross - calibration with subsequently scheduled pacs spectrometer observations of the same target , showed that there was already an increase in the evaporator temperature ( cf .
the course of the temperature in fig .
[ fig : cooler_cycles ] with an increase of up to 5mk for the two cycles labeled a081 and a093 ; for the naming convention see beginning of sect .
[ sec : statistics ] and online table  [ tab : cooler_statistics_1 ] ) with an impact on the photometric calibration accuracy ( @xcite ,  @xcite ) .
this effect is described in detail and characterized by appropriate correction functions in  @xcite . despite the final calibration and correction of this effect
, it was decided to increase t@xmath12 to 3h , which meant that the evaporator temperature increased by at most 1mk at the end of the cooler period .
this meant a maximum contiguous pacs photometer operation of 57.8h .    ) representing the four different operational periods with regard to biasing the detectors .

a total number of 239 pacs cooler recyclings was performed during the _ herschel _ mission , the first one on od26 for pacs commissioning and the last one on od1443 .
139 cooler recyclings were performed as pacs only ( labeled `` a '' plus a sequence number ) , 100 recyclings in parallel with the spire cooler recycling ( labeled `` b '' plus a sequence number ) .
it should be noted that the parallel cooler recyclings were not only performed for parallel mode observations of pacs and spire , but also for separate pacs and spire observations during the subsequent hold time periods .
the spire cooler hold time was restricted to about 48h , the difference between the pacs and spire cooler hold times was usually covered by pacs photometer observations to achieve the highest possible efficiency of each cooler recycling with regard to the foreseen and available photometer observing program .
online table  [ tab : cooler_statistics_1 ] gives an overview of all cooler cycles with the achieved hold time and the duration of the pacs detector operations during this hold time .
it can be recognized that in the beginning of the mission the detector operational times were relatively short owing to the step - by - step commissioning and performance assessment of the pacs photometer . from about od200
onwards , routine observations started achieving usually 40 
50h of photometer operations , but this depended also on the instrument allocation per operational day due to target visibility and priority of the observations . in the beginning
, the pacs photometer was operated in a safe manner , it was switched into its standby mode by an orbit epilogue aor , i.e. detectors were de - biased , at the end of each od and whenever another instrument became prime .
this is reflected in the usual 2  3 bias periods during this time .
this safety aspect could be relaxed along the mission due to the smooth operation of the _ herschel _ space observatory . from od675 onwards ,
the pacs photometer was switched to standby mode after the first od of a photometer block , but was then left in biased mode for the subsequent 1.5 ods . from od732 onwards ,
the pacs photometer was kept in biased mode for the full 2.5ods , thus reaching maximum biased times of up to 59.2h , and later 57.8h after increasing the buffer time at the end of the hold time ( see sect .  [ sec : holdtime_relation ] ) . from od824
onwards , pacs and spire were operated in most cases simultaneously in prime mode following a parallel cooler recycling without interference in their hk telemetry .
this saved time , which had to be spent for the instrument set - up from standby into biased mode , for science observations , but did not mean full permanent observations with pacs during the biased time due to spacecraft operations windows or spire only observations .
nevertheless , this final way of operation yielded the most optimum usage of the pacs and spire photometers for science observations .
[ fig : cooler_cycles ] shows individual cooler cycles from these different modes of operating the detectors .
the periods of unbiased detectors can be clearly recognized by a temperature drop of about 4mk .
after biasing the detectors again , the temperature goes up to the previous level .
there is a relatively smooth slight increase of the evaporator temperature during the cycle until the very end when the temperature rises much more steeply .
depending on the safety buffer , this final increase ranges from less than 1mk for the 3h buffer to about 5mk for the 1.5h buffer .    when inspecting the shape of the cooler evaporator temperature along the cooler cycle , we can distinguish two main types , as illustrated for two subsequent cycles undisturbed by detector bias switching in fig .
[ fig : cooler_bump ] ( this characteristic difference applies in general also for cycles with detector bias switching ) .    * following the drop to the operational temperature between 282 and 283mk ( if detectors are already biased ) , the evaporator temperature shows a flat increase .
around 24h after the start of the cooler recycling , there is a 1mk high swell in the temperature curve .
this usually occurs at around 24h ( not always at exactly the same time ) , but there are some cases when it already occurs after less than 10h or only after more than 30h . *
directly after the drop , there is an initial dip followed by the flat temperature rise .
a swell does not occur during this cycle .    .
, title=""fig:"",scaledwidth=49.0% ] .
, title=""fig:"",scaledwidth=49.0% ]    most of the cooler cycles , both pacs only and parallel , show the `` swell '' shape .
column 9 in table  [ tab : cooler_statistics_1 ] indicates the shape for each cooler cycle .
`` swell''-type cycles start at a lower temperature level than `` dip''-type cycles and reach the temperature level of the `` dip''-type cycle at the time of the `` swell '' .
the duration of the `` swell '' is 2 - 3h .
the `` dip '' has a similar duration .    as a summary of the described characteristics of the evaporator temperature evolution , fig .
[ fig : cooler_curves ] shows a superposition of all cooler cycles with full hold time and without de - biasing in - between , separately for pacs - only and parallel mode cycles .
this reveals fine differences for the two modes of operations .
parallel cycles show an on average slightly higher temperature level , which indicates some small impact by the parallel operations of the spire instrument .
this impact is confirmed by the temperature drop after about 48h , when spire operations terminate .
thanks to the photometric calibration method correcting for time dependent evaporator temperature variation ( @xcite ) , all photometric measurements are put on a homogeneous temperature reference level .
the `` dip - type '' evaporator temperature curves look similar to the observed on - ground behavior .
the `` dip '' appears therefore to be a consequence of the relative timing of the end of the cooler recycling procedure , when the evaporator temperature still drops , and the bias setting of the detectors as part of the orbit prologue procedure , which leads to the turn of the temperature curve to the level for biased detectors .
we have investigated whether the evaporator temperature `` swell '' is related to instrument or satellite specific activities .
we could not find any strong correlation with instrument switching , long slews , in particular the concluding ones of an od , or spacecraft operational windows for reaction wheel de - biasing .
the physical reason behind the occurrence of the `` swells '' in the evaporator temperature remains therefore an open issue .
we believe it to be a zero gravity effect , possibly related to the liquid arrangement inside the porous material , since it was never observed during tests of the cooler system on ground .
note that for the spire cooler a similar phenomenon has been reported , which has been called the `` spire cooler burp '' .    .
labels `` a '' and `` b '' with a sequence number represent a pacs - only or a parallel mode cycle , respectively .
, title=""fig:"",scaledwidth=49.0% ] .
labels `` a '' and `` b '' with a sequence number represent a pacs - only or a parallel mode cycle , respectively .
, title=""fig:"",scaledwidth=49.0% ]    we also investigated the impact of the detector operations on the shape of the evaporator cooler temperature curve .
this is illustrated in fig .
[ fig : detector_operations ] .
even with the brightest measurable sources on the detector , the illumination did not cause any noticeable deviations of the evaporator temperature .
a noticeable effect could be recognized when the detectors were operated with different bias settings , but this was restricted to a few engineering and calibration observations only .
[ fig : holdtime_mission ] shows the relation of the cooler hold time versus the biased time for all complete cooler cycles during the mission ( 192 out of 239 , 115 out of 139 pacs only , 77 out of 100 parallel ) .
cooler periods flagged in table  [ tab : cooler_statistics_1 ] by a banner `` @xmath13 '' in the column hold time were not considered , because of their truncation by the start of a new cooler recycling under cold start conditions before the final exhaustion of the liquid @xmath0he .    .
different symbols and colors represent pacs only or parallel mode cooler recyclings and the start conditions from a warm , i.e.  exhausted liquid @xmath0he , or a cold , i.e. still available liquid @xmath0he , cooler . the operational guideline established from the relation of all cooler periods up to od270 ( cf .

[ sec : holdtime_relation ] and fig .
[ fig : holdtime_relation ] , as represented by the red line in fig .
[ fig : holdtime_mission ] with a dispersion of @xmath140.5h .
the parallel cooler recyclings starting from a warm cooler are slightly shifted to an about 1h shorter cooler hold time with a similar dispersion .
this one hour less efficiency was well covered by the buffer time applied for mission planning aspects as described in sect .
[ sec : holdtime_relation ] .
statistics for the cooler recyclings starting from a still cold cooler are poorer , but there is some indication that the hold times both for pacs - only and parallel cooler recycling are about 0.5h longer than for the warm start pacs - only cooler recyclings .
there are a few outliers with hold times shorter by 1.5 to 3h than comparable cycles which are restricted to one period between od101 and od132 .
note that this period largely coincides with the period when the bias voltage settings of the pacs detectors were still being varied for detector performance optimization ( prior to od128 ) .
formal linear fits like the one for the general hold time relation in eqn(1 ) yield + for  all  cycles : @xmath15 for pacs - only cycles with warm start : @xmath16 for pacs - only cycles with cold start : @xmath17 for parallel cycles with warm start : @xmath18 for parallel cycles with cold start : @xmath19    investigation of the cause for the dispersion in cooler hold time for the same biased time has to consider the following aspects :    * short term variations of the thermal environment in the order of days .
* systematic trends along the _ herschel _ mission .
this investigation is illustrated in fig .
[ fig : cooler_od ] . for a homogeneous comparison of cooler cycles with very different biased times
we calculate the zero bias hold time @xmath20 as @xmath21    with @xmath22 being the factors in the relations of eqns .
( 4 ) and ( 6 ) , respectively . to account for the slightly different average hold times of pacs only and parallel mode recyclings
, the difference of the offsets ( 72.523h - 72.351h = 0.172h ) has been added to @xmath20 of parallel cycles .
[ fig : cooler_od ] features the following characteristics    * there is quite some dispersion up to about od200 including the mentioned outliers . * from od200
onwards there are periods with quite low dispersion in @xmath20 interrupted by periods with higher scatter .
* there appears to be a slight downward trend of @xmath20 along the mission .    in trying to find correlations with instrument temperature sensing , the pacs instrument optical bench temperature ( in the range 10 - 13k ) appears to reflect individual features and overall trends ( cf .
fig.[fig : cooler_od ] ) .
note that this is an anti - correlation with low optical bench temperatures corresponding to long hold times and vice versa .
it is not always a 1-to-1 anti - correlation in time , but the thermal history also has to be considered . the pacs optical bench temperature is a representation of the total thermal load into the pacs instrument .
it depends on activities of all systems inside the cryostat .
switch - off of one of the three instruments , e.g. due to contingency mainly by cosmic ray hits , can cause a significant drop of the thermal load .
the thermal load and environment can have an impact both on the recycling process and the evaporation level .
we noted some slight systematic variations of the evaporator temperature curves during the recycling , like an increase of the peak temperature and the final 2k level of the recycling , with proceeding mission .
he content in the _ herschel _ cryostat on the basis of three dedicated direct liquid content measurements ( dlcm ) on ods196 , 538 , and 741 .
the solid green and red lines give the best and worst linear fit to the three data points .
the point at od0 is the mass estimate after the final helium top - up of the herschel cryostat prior to launch . due to the cool - down of the telescope during the first 2 months
, the initial helium consumption is different excluding this point from the fit of the remaining mass in - orbit ( source : esa ) .
, scaledwidth=100.0% ]
the lifetime of a cryogenic mission is usually determined by the consumption of the initial mass of coolant . in the case of _ herschel _ this was the amount of superfluid @xmath1he carried inside the instrument cryostat . for a realistic mission planning trying to execute the essential scientific program a feedback on the remaining lifetime is very helpful .
for that reason the _ herschel _ cryostat was equipped with special heaters to perform direct liquid content measurements ( dlcm ) .
three measurements of this type were performed on ods196 , 538 and 741 by sending a dedicated heat pulse into the superfluid @xmath1he and watching its thermal reaction .
this meant however each time the interruption of the scientific observations for several hours to achieve stable thermal conditions and the results did not show a smooth gradual reduction of the @xmath1he mass content , leaving a relatively large uncertainty of about 4 months in lifetime , cf .
[ fig : dlcm - lhelifetime ] .
the pacs team cryogenic experts developed an alternative method utilizing the regularly executed cooler recyclings of pacs and spire . during the recyclings a well reproducible heat dissipation from the cooler pump into the superfluid @xmath1he l0 bath of the herschel cryostat took place .
[ fig : cooler - lhelifetime ] ( top ) shows the corresponding measured temperature rise , which is the higher the less superfluid @xmath1he remains .
a smooth and well sampled trend was observed with this method .

, title=""fig:"",scaledwidth=100.0% ]    with the knowledge of the tank volume , the specific heat capacities of superfluid @xmath1he and he gas in the ullage and the density of both phases , the remaining superfluid @xmath1he mass can be determined .
this is plotted in fig .
[ fig : cooler - lhelifetime ] ( bottom ) and led to a prediction for end of life in the second half of march 2013 .
the actual superfluid @xmath1he boil - off happened on 29 april 2013 , i.e. the superfluid @xmath1he lifetime turned out to be one month longer than predicted .
this is owed to uncertainties in both the adopted physical properties , like e.g.the values of the specific heat capacities , and the start conditions , namely the initial superfluid @xmath1he mass in the tank at launch .
the shape of the relevant cooler temperatures during the recycling as shown in fig .
[ fig : recycling_temperatures ] was highly reproducible during the whole _
mission until the last recycling on od1443 , with one exception for the second - to - last recycling on od1440 , 1 week before the boil - off of the liquid @xmath1he in the large _ herschel _ cryostat tank .
[ fig : recycling_nonnominal ] shows the temperature evolution which can be compared with the one shown in fig .
[ fig : recycling_temperatures ] .
it can be noted that temp_ev exceeds 3.5k during the heating of the pump and that the `` knee '' at around 117min after thermally disconnecting the evaporator ( hse = 0 ) and closing the pump heater switch ( hsp ) is at 2k and not below . as pointed out in sect .
[ sec : cooler_recycling ] , the finally achieved temp_ev in this step characterizes the efficiency of the recycling .
this led to a 3.3h shorter cooler hold time than anticipated ( see sect .
[ sec : holdtime_relation ] and table  [ tab : cooler_statistics_1 ] ) . due to a safety buffer of 3h taken into account by the science mission
planning only 0.3h of pacs photometer observations were lost .
the likely explanation for this behavior is that the remaining liquid @xmath1he film was broken or too thin so that the heat dissipation from the pump was not perfect .
this is also reflected in the otherwise not observed bumps in temp_ts and temp_fpu_st at about 128min .
this event was the only sign before the final boil - off , that the liquid @xmath1he reserve was close to its end .
the liquid @xmath1he film recovered again for the next and final pacs cooler recycling on od1443 .
* the pacs @xmath0he sorption cooler exceeded the required cooler hold time of 46h by at least 15h depending on the operational time of the pacs bolometer detectors .
the biased time of the detectors is the essential parameter for the resulting hold time .
we did not observe any sign of aging effect of the device , despite more than 9 years of operations , almost 4 of them in space .
* an automatic cooler recycling procedure , assembling the necessary steps with the right timing , worked highly reproducible over the whole mission until the last cooler recycling 4 days before the liquid @xmath1he boil - off in the _ herschel _ cryostat .
the only slightly non - nominal recycling with a 5% shorter hold time on od1440 can be explained by a disturbed thermal interface to the liquid @xmath1he bath 1 week before the boil - off . in total ,
139 automatic pacs cooler recyclings and 100 automatic parallel ( with spire ) cooler recyclings were executed during the herschel mission . * the dependence of the cooler hold time on the detector operational time ( biased detectors ) was established early in the mission and worked reliably for the science mission planning process over the entire _ herschel _ mission .
* we give a statistics of all pacs cooler recyclings over the full _ herschel _ mission . from this
fine differences in the performance of the different modes and start conditions can be seen .
parallel cooler recyclings starting with a warm cooler give an about 1h shorter hold time than pacs - only recyclings .
cooler recyclings starting from a still cold cooler give an about 0.5h longer hold time than the warm start pacs - only recycling .
* we characterize the cooler cycles into two main classes : ( 1 ) dip - type cycles starting at a slightly higher level ( @xmath41mk in evaporator temperature ) and , for the majority , ( 2 ) swell - type cycles starting at a slightly lower level and usually showing a temperature swell of 1mk after around 24h adjusting then to the level of the dip - type cycles .
the physical reason for this `` swell '' is unclear , it appears to be a zero gravity effect .
the `` dip - type '' shapes were also observed during ground tests of the device and seem to be the consequence of relative timing of evaporator temperature evolution and detector bias switching .
we also noted a systematically slightly higher evaporator temperature level for parallel cooler cycles during the time interval of spire operations .
illumination conditions of the detectors could be ruled out as negligible .
* we investigated the cause for the dispersion of cooler hold times of cycles with similar biased time , same mode and start condition , which is in the order of about 1h . by determining
a zero bias hold time , allowing a homogeneous comparison of all cycles , we have seen that the dispersion is caused by trends and different thermal loads into the pacs instrument along the _ herschel _ mission .
this was concluded from the fact that the pacs optical bench temperature sensor showed a quite good anti - correlation both with regard to long term trends and short term scatter . a few outliers with noticeable shorter hold times
can be related to a confined period between od101 and od132 early in the mission , when larger temperature load variations occurred . *
the evolution of the cooler evaporator temperature during the individual cooler cycles was studied and the impact of the temperature variation on the bolometer response and hence the photometric accuracy during the biased times could be characterized very well and corrections improving the relative calibration accuracy were established as described in @xcite . *
we sketch a method of @xmath1he mass content determination evaluating the temperature response of the @xmath1he coolant in the large _ herschel _ cryostat to the constant heat deposition of the @xmath0he sorption cooler pump at the end of the recycling process .
this gave a much denser and hence robust against individual outliers coverage of the mass content curve for zero cost as an alternative to few dedicated direct liquid content measurements ( dlcm ) requiring the interrupt of the scientific operations .
the accuracy of the method utilizing the anyhow performed cooler recyclings is solely limited by uncertainties in the adopted physical properties , like e.g.  the values of the specific heat capacities , and the start conditions , namely the initial superfluid @xmath1he mass in the tank at launch .

appendix a: common uplink system (cus) command script for pacs cooler recycling",What role does the Herschel Space Observatory play in advancing our understanding of star formation?,The Herschel Space Observatory uses advanced cooling technology to observe cold regions of space. It provides key insights into the early stages of star and galaxy formation by detecting far-infrared and submillimeter wavelengths.," The Herschel Space Observatory plays a pivotal role in advancing our understanding of star formation by providing extensive observations in the infrared and millimeter wavelengths. Its unique capabilities in resolving dust and gas at these wavelengths have allowed astronomers to study the processes that lead to the formation of stars, such as the accretion of massive gas clouds into disks and the formation of young stars from these disks. By observing the characteristics of these disks, including their composition and structure, scientists can gain insights into how stars are born and evolve over time. Additionally, the Herschel Space Observatory has helped identify and classify different types of stellar objects, such as brown dwarfs and supergiants, which have been crucial for developing models of stellar formation.

as described by the tpf science working group , the primary challenges of the terrestrial planet finder ( tpf ) are to `` _ _ detect radiation from earth - like planets in the habitable zones _ _ surrounding a statistically valid sample of @xmath0 150 solar type ( spectral types f , g , and k ) stars , to characterize the _
orbital _ and _ physical _ properties of all detected planets to assess their habitability , and to characterize the _ atmospheres _ and search for potential
_ biomarkers _ among the brightest candidates . ''
the specified number of stars is a compromise between providing a high probability of success in finding habitable planets , setting a meaningful limit on the prevalence of planets in the event of a negative result , and the demands on the observing system .
the average distance to the stars with terrestrial planets is perhaps the most critical parameter that sets the scale of tpf .
the baseline tpf concept calls for operation toward stars as far away as @xmath015 pc , beyond which distance either the angular resolution or sensitivity become insufficient .
if , however , earths were known to be ubiquitous , then one could concentrate on the closest stars ( ` < ` 5 pc ) using smaller telescopes and lower angular resolution .
conversely , if earths were known to be rare , it would be necessary to use larger telescopes to look beyond 15 pc to find even a few examples . thus a major goal for a precursor
tpf science program is to assess the fraction of stars with terrestrial planets in the habitable zones , denoted @xmath1 . a lesser but still valuable goal would be to assess the fraction of systems with giant planets located _ only _ beyond the habitable zone so that earths would have a chance to form and survive on stable orbits .    [ [ almost - everything - i - know - about - planets - i - learned - from - radial - velocities ] ] ( almost ) everything
i know about planets i learned from radial velocities ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    as described at this conference , the radial velocity ( rv ) technique ( mayor and queloz 1995 ; marcy and butler 2000 ) has proven to be the most successful technique to date in finding planets and even planetary systems . with almost 50 planets now known
( see the invaluable _ extrasolar planets encyclopaedia _ at _ http://www.obspm.fr/planets_ ; schneider 1996 ) , we have learned that approximately 5% of stars have gas giant planets located within a few au of their parent star and ranging in size from 0.17/_sin  i _
m@xmath2 ( marcy & butler , this conference ; and udry , mayor & queloz 2000 ) to beyond the 13 m@xmath2 deuterium burning limit .
as many have noted , these gas giants all exist at orbital radii well within water - ice condensation line thought to be the interior limit for the accretion of such planets .
whether this discrepancy is due to dynamical effects or to an insufficient understanding of the mechanisms of planet formation is a matter of great debate .
while only two planetary _ systems _ are known , ( @xmath3 and and hd83443 ) , marcy ( this conference ) claims that the residuals in the rv data for half of his sample exceed the experimental uncertainties and are highly suggestive of the presence of planets with periods longer than the present observational datasets . while multiple systems may eventually prove be common , as yet we know of no counterpart to our own `` grand design '' solar system with gas giants on circular orbits located beyond the water - ice condensation line and rocky planets nestled within the habitable zone .
furthermore , the broad range of eccentricities and small orbital radii of the known giant planets may be inconsistent with the existence of habitable , terrestrial planets .
some have argued that these unexpected results mean that solar systems like our own are rare .
however , many would argue that we are simply reaping the fruits of using a technique ( radial velocity ) that is biased toward finding gas giant planets on short period orbits .
what are the properties of the solar systems ( if any ) orbiting the 95% of solar type stars for which the rv technique has to date set only upper limits ? to make further progress we need rv data over longer periods to probe larger orbital distances , but we also need qualitatively new types of data .      a second technique that has recently borne fruit is the measurement of the transit of a planet in an edge - on orbit across the face of its parent star .
the detection of the transits of hd 209458 ( charbonneau et al .
2000 ; henry et al .
2000 ) is a spectacular demonstration of the power of this technique and a validation of the planetary interpretation of the rv data .
in addition to giving the planet s true mass ( by determining the inclination angle ) , radius and density , spectroscopic observations might even reveal information the composition ( sasselov and seager 2000 ) .
on the other hand , the failure to find any transits toward to 3.4@xmath4 stars in the globular cluster 47 tucanae ( gilliland et al . 2000 ) is an indication that not all environments are hospitable to the formation or survival of planets .
while jupiter - sized planets present a readily observable transit signal of 1.5% , earths produce a signal that is only @xmath5 in depth .
however , if the @xmath6 accuracy of the recent hst observations of hd 209458 ( brown et al .
2000 , this conference ) can be replicated or improved on in an imaging system , then the detection of earths around other stars is plausible .
a wide area survey of @xmath7 stars is required because transits are rare due to the requirement for precise alignment  1 ( 10)% for planets at 1 ( 0.1 ) au  and infrequent due to orbital periods ranging from a few months up to once per year for a planet at 1 au .
a number of groups are either already making such observations on the ground ( borucki et al .
2000 ; howell et al .
2000 ) or proposing them for space missions , including kepler in the us ( koch et al . 1998 ) and eddington / corot in europe ( leger _ et al_. 2000 ) .
these projects would target solar type stars typically a few 100 to 1,000 pc away in fields of 10 - 100 sq .
since these weak signals must be measured at least three times to identify and then confirm their presence , a mission dureation of at least 3 - 4 years is required to find planets in the habitable zone .
searches for planets by gravitational microlensing take advantage of the fact that the presence of a second mass in a lens system produces multiple images of a background star .
the lensing star produces a magnification of the background star s brightness that lasts a month or longer and which can be as great as a factor of 3 to 10 .
the second mass , located within a few au of the central star , produces an additional magnification of a few percent up to a factor of two , lasting anywhere from a few days for a jupiter to a few hours for an earth ( peale 1997 ) .
a number of groups have reported detections of binary stars and , with less certainty , of objects of jovian mass ( alcock et al .
the frequency of these events is , unfortunately , quite low so that @xmath8 stars must be monitored continuously if the hours - long enhancements due to an earth are to be detected .
advantages of the microlensing technique include the large photometric signal , the early identification of the lensing system which can then be constantly monitored , the well defined signature of a microlensing event , and the ability to find free floating planets .
the disadvantages include the great distances to the lensing star and the background stars ( 4 and 8 kpc , respectively ) , and the fact that the derived mass of the planet depends on the poorly known stellar mass .
further , most of the lensing stars will typically be m dwarfs or smaller and thus not direct solar analogs .
proponents of both ground - based programs and space - based missions such as gest ( bennett et al .
2000 ) have suggested that microlensing can reliably find tens of earths per year .
the complementary technique to radial velocities for searching for planets around _
nearby stars _ is astrometry .
astrometry is relatively unaffected by the photospheric motions that limit the rv technique to detections of @xmath0 saturn - mass planets .
furthermore , astrometric signals grow rather than shrink with increasing orbital distance , reversing the selection bias that affects rv measurements .
the scale of the astrometric measurement challenge is set by two cases : the signal of a jupiter orbiting 5 au away from a g2v star 10 pc away is @xmath0500 @xmath9as while the astrometric signal of an earth orbiting 1 au away the same star is @xmath00.3 @xmath9as . detecting a planet of unknown period and amplitude
requires a dataset extending at least as long as half the planet s orbital period . for reliable planet detection , the _ single measurement accuracy _ must be approximately half of the astrometric amplitude of the planetary signal ( brown et al .
1999 ) .
but these projects do not provide all the information we might require .
projects that are not presently in the program that would be of considerable utility include the following : + @xmath10 a mission to determine @xmath1 from either transits or microlensing would set the distance scale for tpf and determine the required aperture size and angular resolution needed for a high probability of success in finding earths .
while the corot mission is a good first step , a mission on the scale of eddington or kepler is required for robust statistics .
an intensive ground - based microlensing campaign would a valuable near - term adjunct to this effort .
@xmath10 a scaled down version of a nulling ir interferometer would detect and characterize giant planets around nearby stars , detect earths ( if any ) around the nearest stars , and demonstrate the technologies needed for more capable missions in the future .
+ from the programmatic standpoint , the problem with these intermediate missions is that they will be expensive and are likely to delay the start of tpf , particularly if we have to wait for their results .
the transit , microlensing , and coronagraphic missions have all been proposed for nasa s discovery program which has a @xmath0$300 m cost cap ; realistic missions might cost even more .
a scaled down nulling ir interferometer could easily cost as much as sim .
thus if we require these missions as precursors , we must accept delays in tpf and higher program costs .

if an adequate number of stars can be observed with the requisite precision in a discovery - class mission , then either a transit or a microlensing experiment would bolster our confidence in the goals of tpf and set the distance scale for planet searches .

the present nasa plan for tpf involves an ir nulling interferometer based on technology from the sim , ngst , and st-3 missions . with a suitable redirection of technology funds ,
this plan would support a coronagraph alternative if the results of the ongoing studies are favorable .
however , this schedule would not allow us to incorporate into the _ design _ of tpf the knowledge gleaned from a transit or microlensing experiment , or from the sim mission .
the scale of tpf would have to be set by the compromise described above of wanting to observe @xmath0150 stars out to @xmath015 pc .

could not be launched before 2015 .
achieving a high degree of certainty requires that we wait a very long time !
the most aggressive approach , i.e. the present origins plan , would be to proceed at full speed with the nominal tpf ( element 3 ) . while one never has absolute certainty of what one will find in exploration ,

the decision between the two approaches should be made on the basis of technological readiness .

finding planets before tpf",What observational techniques are most effective for identifying exoplanets with conditions suitable for liquid water?,"Techniques like transit photometry and radial velocity measurements help identify exoplanets. These methods determine planetary size, orbit, and atmospheric composition to assess the presence of liquid water and other life-supporting conditions."," The observational techniques most effective for identifying exoplanets with conditions suitable for liquid water include ground-based telescopes such as Kepler, which has been instrumental in discovering many Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone. Additionally, space missions like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have improved our ability to detect and characterize these planets, providing more detailed information about their atmospheres and potential for liquid water. Furthermore, the use of photometric observations and spectroscopic techniques can help identify exoplanets that are more conducive to hosting liquid water, such as those with strong atmospheric gradients and clear skies. These methods have greatly contributed to our understanding of the potential habitability of other solar systems.<|im_end|>"," Observational techniques such as transit spectroscopy, radial velocity surveys, and microlensing have been most effective for identifying exoplanets with conditions suitable for liquid water. These methods can detect planets that transit their host stars, allowing astronomers to measure the planet's brightness variation caused by its orbit around the star. Radial velocity surveys can detect planets with orbital periods of up to several years, while microlensing observations can detect planets with orbital periods of up to several hours. Additionally, transits spectroscopy has been used to analyze the chemical composition of exoplanets and can help identify planets with conditions suitable for liquid water. Overall, these techniques offer a comprehensive approach to detecting and studying exoplanets with conditions suitable for liquid water.<|im_end|>"
11,186421,"silo discharge and the flow of granulates through narrow orifices are important ubiquitously in everyday life and in technological processes .
a huge number of experimental , as well as numerical studies have been performed over many years to understand the underlying processes ( e. g. @xcite ) .
the spontaneous formation of arches  @xcite , the kinetics preceding arch formation @xcite , forces and force chains  @xcite , and arch breaking @xcite are among the important features when one is interested in the prevention of silo clogging .
the formation of arches , i. e. arrangements of grains at the outlet of a two - dimensional hopper that block outflow , was analyzed in a pioneering study by to et al .
@xcite . for disks in a two dimensional silo , they found that the arch span is always larger than the opening of the silo and that for frictionless particles the arch is convex everywhere . introducing friction they found clogging events where the arch at the opening may not be convex locally .
in addition , they determined the jamming probability as a function of the size of the hopper opening .
clogging probabilities were also measured not only for spheres but also for one type of elongated grains by zuriguel et al .
@xcite in a three dimensional silo . in their model ,
the mean avalanche size between two clogging events could be fitted with a power law .
the model assumes a critical radius @xmath0 of the orifice , above which the hopper outflow is continuous , without clogging .
however , the divergence of the mean avalanche size with increasing orifice radius @xmath1 according to the model in ref .
@xcite is proportional to @xmath2 , so it is very difficult to confirm the existence of such a critical radius experimentally with reasonable amounts of grains available .
recent work by thomas and durian @xcite brought new insights in clogging probabilities , flow rates and mean avalanche sizes in hoppers of different geometries .
they proposed a description of clogging events based on an assumed poisson distribution of clogging events .
their model yields an exponential increase of avalanche sizes with increasing hopper orifice radius , so that no critical @xmath0 exists .
these two descriptions are not much distinct from a practical point of view , when one assumes that the critical hole size is defined by clogging events becoming highly improbable and practically unobservable above a certain radius .    since silo discharge is important for many processes in everyday life and the industry , a large number of studies
have been performed both experimentally and numerically over years in order to understand silo dynamics  @xcite , including horizontal apertures  @xcite or tubes  @xcite .
related phenomena where a distinct number of objects has to pass a bottleneck , for example escape panics  @xcite , traffic jams  @xcite and animal behavior  @xcite , are in several respects similar to silo outflow .
the geometrical features of force chains and arches before and in the clogged state can be visualized using photoelastic disks @xcite in 2d hoppers . during the outflow , arches form in the granular material even in regions well above the orifice of the silo , but they are dynamic and form only intermittent networks of contact forces .
the outflow is not controlled by this network , but the network of contact forces is responsible for fluctuations in the velocity field .
clogging occurs in 2d by the formation of an arch with an uninterrupted force chain at the orifice .
this structure remains static unless it is broken by external forces . in 3d
, one expects an analogous scenario .
internal force chains are much more difficult to visualize there than in 2d , therefore a detailed characterization of 3d clogs is still missing
. we will refer to these structures in the following as domes , the 3d analogies of a 2d arch , meaning a shell of grains at the outlet forming a closed net of force chains above the orifice .
until now , many investigations of hopper flow were focused on spherical ( 3d ) or disk shaped ( 2d ) particles with only a few studies providing data for shape - anisotropic grains , for example refs .
@xcite . in order to quantify how the discharge rate is affected by changing the particle aspect ratio , numerical ( dem ) methods are the most appropriate . here
one can tune the aspect ratio by leaving the other important parameters ( particle volume , surface friction , etc . ) the same .
the aspect ratio dependence is not well understood yet , as in 2d systems cleary and sawley found reduced flow rates for elongated particles with _
friction @xcite , while langston found increased flow rates for elongated particles with _
friction @xcite compared to the case of circles . in 3d simulations
langston found the same flow rate for sphere and sphero - cylinders with zero friction @xcite , while liu found a reduced flow rates for both prolate and oblate ellipsoids with nonzero friction @xcite . on
the other hand li reported increased flow rates for oblate ellipsoids with nonzero friction @xcite .
the geometry of the flow field also depended on the aspect ratio , as the flow was rather concentrated to a central zone for nonspherical grains resulting in a larger stagnant zone near the silo walls @xcite .
the consequences of anisometric grain shape for the static and dynamic properties of granular systems have been highlighted in various recent communications @xcite and reviews @xcite .
some examples are effects of particle elongation on disordered packing @xcite , self - organized criticality on a heap @xcite , ordering in shaken systems @xcite or secondary convection in cylindrical shear flows @xcite .    in the present experimental study
, we analyze the effect of shape anisometry of granular particles on hopper flow and clogging by means x - ray tomography . for this purpose
we use elongated pegs , flat lentils and nearly spherical peas .
these particles have sizes of several millimeters , and can be detected and individually distinguished in the recorded x - ray tomograms .
the silo is a cylindrical bucket with changeable orifice size .
the size is chosen such that clogging occurs after finite avalanche sizes .
the tomograms are recorded in the clogged state with the grains at rest . from comparison of subsequent clogs
, we can characterize the flow field ( streamlines ) of the granulate in the silo .
we find all positions and orientations of individual particles in the clogged state , and use the tomographic data to calculate the packing fractions and particle orientations .
the tomograms also give information about the shape of the domes , as well as on the orientation of particles forming the dome .
the experiments were performed with a small plastic silo consisting of a bucket of a diameter of @xmath3  cm and a height of @xmath4  cm .
the aperture of the outlet was adjustable by exchanging insets in the center of the bottom plane .
the bottom of the bucket has a quadratic opening of about @xmath5  @xmath6 , where different plates with circular holes were inserted , hole sizes could be chosen in 0.5  mm radius steps . a schematic drawing of the silo is shown in fig .  [ fig : aufb1 ] .
( b ) @xmath7 , ( c ) @xmath8 , ( d ) @xmath9 , and ( e ) @xmath10 , ( f ) chocolate lentils with @xmath11 , ( g ) peas with @xmath12 .
the horizontal bars correspond to 1 cm . ]
the different granulates studied in this setup are also shown in fig .
[ fig : aufb1 ] . to characterize the deviation from the spherical shape we use two different quantities : ( 1 ) the aspect ratio @xmath13 , which is the ratio of the size of the particle along its rotational axis and perpendicular to it and ( 2 ) the equivalent radius @xmath14 which is the radius of a sphere with the same volume as the particle .
the following materials were used :    * wooden pegs with cylinder shape and tapered ends , diameter @xmath15  mm , length @xmath16  mm , aspect ratio @xmath17 , equivalent radius @xmath18  mm * wooden pegs with cylinder shape and tapered ends , @xmath15  mm , @xmath19  mm , @xmath8 , @xmath20  mm * wooden pegs with cylinder shape and tapered ends , @xmath21  mm , @xmath22  mm , @xmath23 , @xmath24  mm * wooden pegs with cylinder shape , @xmath15  mm , @xmath25  mm , @xmath10 , @xmath26  mm * ellipsoidal chocolate lentils ( _ piasten _ ) covered with hard icing with @xmath27  mm and @xmath28  mm , @xmath29 , @xmath30  mm * peas , with small deviations from a perfect sphere , polydisperse with mean diameter of 7.6  mm , standard deviation 0.23  mm , @xmath31  mm    two types of pegs ( q = 8 , 3.3 ) and some of the particles of the other two types ( q = 5 , 2 ) have slight axial groves on their surfaces .    for the preparation of the experiment , the silo outlet is closed first .
then the container is filled with the grains .
we have selected the outlet sizes for the individual grain types such that after the bottom hole is opened , the granulate flows out but clogs after an appropriate time .
the conditions for a well prepared state are that the avalanche is sufficiently large to create a representative flow and alignment pattern in the container , and that the avalanche stops by clogging when there is still enough material in the container cover more than the region covered in the subsequent tomogram . in this clogged state ,
an x - ray tomogram of the lower half of the silo is recorded .
we use the robot - based flat panel x - ray c - arm system siemens artis zeego of the stimulate - lab , otto von guericke university , magdeburg .
the chosen spatial resolution was 2.03 pixel / mm , with recorded volumes of 25.2 cm @xmath32 25.2 cm @xmath32 19 cm .
the 3d arrangement of the particles is then determined from the x - ray tomogram .    to calculate the packing density in different parts of the silo
, the tomograms are binarized .
we define a threshold for all voxels , that determines whether the voxel belongs to a grain or not . for that we have to choose carefully the threshold .
our algorithm is based on otsu s method  @xcite and to find a good threshold , we only take the part of the tomogram with particles in it . borders and empty regions are avoided .
afterwards the processed tomograms are averaged for each material .
after this the 3d image is projected to a 2d representation where we average over all equivalent voxels , i. e. voxels with the same distance to the center of rotation and the same height .
this method gives a measure of the relative packing densities in different parts of the silo .     from the principle axis @xmath33 of @xmath34 and the flow direction @xmath35 for ( a ) positive order parameter @xmath36 , and ( b ) negative order parameter @xmath37 .
, title=""fig:"",height=151 ]   from the principle axis @xmath33 of @xmath34 and the flow direction @xmath35 for ( a ) positive order parameter @xmath36 , and ( b ) negative order parameter @xmath37 .
, title=""fig:"",height=151 ]    in order to calculate the streamlines , the nematic order parameter and the average orientation angle , we determined the position and the orientation of the individual particles ; for details see @xcite .
the shear - induced orientational order is monitored by diagonalizing the symmetric traceless nematic order tensor @xmath38 : @xmath39 \quad , \ ] ] where @xmath40 is the unit vector along the long axis of particle @xmath41 , and the sum is over all @xmath42 detected particles in equivalent regions of the silo . for that purpose ,
summation over a large number of particles is needed . as a compromise
, we make the assumption that the flow in the axially symmetric geometry of our silo yields an axially symmetric mean flow field and consequently an axially symmetric mean arrangement of the particles , therefore , we average over ring - shaped zones of the silo .    conventionally , the nematic order parameter @xmath34 is the eigenvalue of the order tensor with the largest absolute value . in the case
@xmath36 ( preferential alignment along a certain axis ) , we will refer to @xmath34 in the definition of flow alignment and define the average flow orientation angle @xmath43 as the angle between @xmath33 ( the eigenvector of @xmath38 corresponding to @xmath34 ) and the local flow direction , see fig .
[ fig : diagram](a ) .    in regions with strong planar influences , i.e. near walls and close to the free surface ,
the orientational ordering of the particles is often fan - like : the axes of the particles are preferentially aligned perpendicular to a certain axis , but azimuthally more or less distributed at random . in that case , @xmath38 has two small positive eigenvalues , and the third one ( @xmath34 ) is negative and has the largest absolute value ( recall that @xmath38 is traceless ) . in that case , we use a different , more descriptive concept to characterize the local alignment : the eigenvector @xmath44 corresponding to @xmath34 marks the direction in which the particles are preferentially _ not _ oriented .
therefore , @xmath43 is defined differently , as the angle between the streamlines and the closest vector in the orientational plane ( plane perpendicular to @xmath44 ) , see fig .
[ fig : diagram](b ) . in this case
, we characterize the flow - induced order by the largest positive eigenvalue @xmath45 .
this helps us to visualize shear induced orientational changes in the entire hopper , since @xmath45 is less susceptible to boundary effects .
central vertical cuts of two subsequent tomograms are presented for pegs with aspect ratio @xmath8 in fig .  [
fig : bsp_q5_tomogramm ] .    .
in the flowing region particles are aligned .
the pictures show the lower 16 cm of the nearly cylindrical hopper , a rectangular mesh of 5 cm @xmath32 5 cm has been superimposed to guide the eye .
a few colored grains indicate the displacement of selected particles between the two subsequent clogged states .
the diameter of the hopper outlet was 35 mm.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    these tomograms were taken after several avalanches , thus the orientation and packing        of the grains reflects the properties of the developed flow ( initial conditions erased in the flowing regions ) . as explained above , these tomograms were taken in the clogged state . during the avalanche between these two tomograms , approximately 60 particles left the hopper .
the displacement of the material due to this avalanche is visualized by a few selected particles which are marked with colors in fig .
[ fig : bsp_q5_tomogramm ] .
it is clearly visible that the central part moves faster , especially approaching the outlet .
stagnant zones can be identified near the walls especially at the bottom of the hopper . in the flowing region particles
are expected to be oriented nearly ( but not exactly ) parallel to the streamlines @xcite .    in order to quantify the ordering and alignment of the particles and
determine the flow field and the density distribution , tomograms from 26 subsequent clogged states have been analyzed . in figures [ fig : theta_s_q5]a - c , the colormaps indicate the density distribution , the effective order parameter ( @xmath45 ) and the average alignment angle ( @xmath43 ) of the particles in the @xmath46 plane .
the alignment angle is defined in the interval @xmath47 .
the alignment angle is measured with respect to the streamlines , which are indicated by white lines . in order to better visualize the correlation between these quantities , on fig .
[ fig : theta_s_q5]a we represented the two other parameters ( the average orientation of the particles and the nematic order parameter ) by ellipses .
the size and orientation of the ellipse represent @xmath34 and @xmath43 in the following way .
the area of the ellipse is proportional to the projection of the average orientation of the particles to the @xmath46 plane . in the flowing region
the rods are aligned due to shear in this plane , so we find ellipses with large area . near the vertical walls , however , the particles are mostly oriented tangentially , thus the area of the ellipse is small . the direction of alignment is reflected in the orientation of the ellipses
the order parameter is represented by the flattening of the ellipses : @xmath48 flattening @xmath49 , where `` @xmath50 '' and `` @xmath51 '' are the lengths of the long and short semi - axes , respectively .
thus @xmath52 ( perfect order ) would be represented by a thin line , and @xmath53 ( isotropic state ) by a circle .
all the above applies for usual ( calamitic ) nematic order , @xmath54 , where the largest absolute - value eigenvalue of @xmath55 coincides with the largest eigenvalue ( full ellipses ) . for the fan - shape oriented case , where the eigenvalue with largest absolute - value is negative ( @xmath56 ) , we draw an empty ellipse with flattening @xmath57 . in those cases the short ( of length `` @xmath51 '' ) semi - axis
is oriented to the axis of the corresponding eigenvector of the order tensor . at these locations ,
the history of the filling procedure or boundary effects produced an initial 2d order , where the orientation of the particles are nearly within a plane , resulting in a negative order parameter . to quantify
the flow induced ordering it is more suitable to take the largest positive eigenvalue as an effective order parameter @xmath45 .
altogether , figure [ fig : theta_s_q5 ] shows that in the flowing ( sheared ) regions we find well oriented rods due to the shear flow , while near the walls tangential alignment is preferred due to the boundary conditions .
we see , that in the shear flow the average orientation is not parallel to the streamlines , but there is a flow alignment angle as expected @xcite .
the sheared regions are characterized with lower packing fraction , consistent with our earlier observation in shear flow , where the shear induced dilation was found to be only partially compensated with a slight density increase due to the ordering of the grains @xcite .    in order to accurately characterize the alignment of the particles in this complex flow field ,
let us recall earlier     as a function of the order parameter @xmath45 .
data from different parts of the hopper are marked with different colors , these regions are marked with the same color in panel ( b ) . the black line in panel ( a ) represents the data from the split bottom couette flow . in panel ( b ) @xmath34 and @xmath43 are marked with ellipses and the streamlines with white lines as in fig .
[ fig : theta_s_q5 ] .
( c ) distribution of particle orientations @xmath58 with respect to the streamlines .
the inset shows the 3 regions in the hopper corresponding to the 3 curves with different colors .
the black curve corresponds to the stationary distribution of the same particles in split bottom couette flow @xcite . ]
data on the behaviour of these particles in a split bottom couette flow @xcite . in that experiment , we sheared the same material in a cylindrical geometry and recorded how the orientational order develops from an initially random sample .
this dataset is presented in fig .
[ fig : theta - streamlines]a by a black line . as the local shear deformation
@xmath59 is increasing , the order parameter rapidly increases and by @xmath60 , it already reaches about @xmath61 . during this time , the average alignment angle strongly decreases from about @xmath62 to about @xmath63 as a consequence of the continuous rotation of the rods due to the shear flow . when the sample is sheared further ( above @xmath64 )
, a stationary state is reached which is characterized by a shear alignment angle of about @xmath65 . in this state
the particles still rotate , but their rotational velocity strongly depends on their orientation , with slow rotation around @xmath66 , resulting in an ensemble averaged alignment of the sample .
this dataset was obtained from 90 x - ray tomograms in the cylindrical split bottom geometry .
focusing on the orientation of the particles in the hopper ( see colored data points in fig .
[ fig : theta - streamlines]a ) , we find that a good part of the sample is well ordered with similar values of @xmath34 and @xmath43 ( see blue data points ) as in stationary shear flow .
this is the region right above the outlet ( indicated with blue ) in fig .
[ fig : theta - streamlines]b , where the sample was exposed to the largest shear deformation .
further upstream where the material was sheared less , we find a smaller order parameter and a larger alignment angle , similarly to the initial stages of the case of simple shear ( see regions with light blue , green , yellow and red colors in fig .
[ fig : theta - streamlines]a - b ) . in order to better track the evolution of the particle orientation in the hopper flow , we present the histogram of the particle orientations for 3 regions in our hopper in fig .
[ fig : theta - streamlines]c .
the three regions are marked with        different colors ( see the inset of fig .  [
fig : theta - streamlines]c ) .
the corresponding 3 curves show gradual narrowing of the angular distribution and decreasing of the average angle as the material is exposed to larger and larger deformation as it is displaced downwards in the hopper . in fig .
[ fig : theta - streamlines]c we also show the histogram of angles of stationary split bottom couette flow ( black line ) .
we see that near the outlet ( blue curve ) the angular distribution almost reached the case of stationary shear .
coming back to fig .
[ fig : theta - streamlines]a , it is remarkable , that the data points taken in the hopper are almost all below the black line ( corresponding to the case of simple shear ) . physically , the difference between the two cases is , that in the hopper the streamlines are strongly converging while in the cylindrical split bottom geometry they run parallel with each other .
thus in the hopper the converging flow leads to particle orientations which are closer to the streamlines than in a simple shear flow .
so far we have presented the flow and orientation fields and the packing density of the particles for one type of pegs ( @xmath8 ) in a hopper . for this we used 26 tomograms , with small particle displacement ( small avalanches ) between the tomograms , so that the flow lines could be identified . in the following , we present the packing density distribution in a hopper for six materials . for these plots , a similar number of tomograms was taken for each material , but here we allowed more grains to flow out of the hopper between subsequent measurements ( compare outlet diameters ) to reduce correlation in the arrangement of the grains .
the resulting packing density plots are shown in fig .
[ fig : dichten_alle ] for pegs with aspect ratio @xmath10 , @xmath9 , @xmath8 and @xmath7 , for lentils and peas .    as it is seen in fig .
[ fig : dichten_alle ] , the density is reduced in the sheared region ( compared to the density in the stagnant zone near the walls ) for all materials due to the shear induced dilation . as expected , the density in the stagnant zone @xmath67 decreases with increasing aspect ratio for all rodlike grains .
the region where @xmath67 was determined is marked with a black rectangle on the images .
the shear induced dilation is stronger for rods , compared to the case of nearly spherical particles ( peas ) .
approaching the outlet from the top along the symmetry axis of the hopper we find a decreasing packing density .
near the outlet there is a practically empty region ( marked with blue ) , the region below the dome .
the upper border of this region corresponds to the dome which holds the material above in this clogged configuration .
we indicated this with a black line , corresponding to @xmath68 of the packing fraction observed in the stagnant zone .
the contour of a hemisphere of equal diameter with the outlet is also marked ( as a white line ) to visualize deviations from a spherical shape . analyzing the shape of the dome , we find that its height decreases with particle elongation for the sequence @xmath69 . for lentils and nearly spherical peas
the dome is similar to the case of @xmath9 .    for pegs with @xmath7
we find a higher dome , we note however , that these particles are relatively large compared to the system size , thus boundary effects might already have an influence in this case .
we should also note that boundaries also induce layering of the particles especially near the bottom wall , where anisometric particles lay flat . in the stagnant zones near the boundaries the inhomogeneities of the density field are stronger compared to the flowing regions , since there is less averaging over different configurations .
we presented experimental data about the packing fraction , grain alignment , orientational order parameter , and flow field in a 3d hopper based on x - ray ct measurements .
we analyzed subsequent clogged states for 6 materials including elongated particles ( pegs ) , lentils , and nearly spherical grains ( peas ) .
we have shown that for elongated particles the grains get ordered in the flowing parts of the silo . similarly to the case of simple shear flows the average orientation of the rods is not parallel to the streamlines but encloses a small angle with it .
the order parameter increases as the grains travel downwards the silo and the local shear deformation grows . in most parts of the hopper
the orientational distribution of the grains did not reach the stationary orientational distribution observed for simpler shear flows .
consequently , in these regions the order parameter is smaller and the average alignment encloses a larger angle with the streamlines than in a simple shear flow . the packing density of the material is smaller in the flowing ( sheared ) regions compared to the stagnant zones .
this density decrease is stronger for elongated grains compared to the case of nearly spherical particles ( peas ) . along the vertical symmetry axis of the hopper the density continuously decreases from top to bottom .    near the outlet the density distribution averaged over many clogged configurations
provides information about the shape of a typical dome , i.e. the last layer of the grains which blocked the flow .
a characteristic feature is the ratio of hole diameter and elevation of the dome above the outlet in the center .
we find that the height of the dome decreases with increasing aspect ratio for pegs with @xmath10 @xmath70 @xmath9 @xmath70 @xmath8 .
this has consequences for the average number of grains that are involved in the formation of the clog , and therefore also for the clogging probability , the avalanche statistics and the critical radius for the divergence of the mean avalanche sizes .
the analysis of these details requires not only the information on the dome shape , but also on the characteristic alignment of particles forming the clog .
this will be treated in a subsequent investigation .

clogging transition of many - particle systems flowing through bottlenecks .
, 4:7324 , 2014 ."," granular material flowing through bottlenecks like the openings of silos tend to clog and to inhibit further flow . 
 we study this phenomenon in a three - dimensional hopper for spherical and shape - anisotropic particles by means of x - ray tomography . 
 the x - ray tomograms provide information on the bulk of the granular filling , and allows to determine the particle positions and orientations inside the silo . 
 in addition , it allows to calculate local packing densities in different parts of the container . 
 we find that in the flowing zone of the silo particles show a preferred orientation and thereby a higher order . similarly 
 to simple shear flows , the average orientation of the particles is not parallel to the streamlines but encloses a certain angle with it . in most parts of the hopper 
 , the angular distribution of the particles did not reach the one corresponding to stationary shear flow , thus the average orientation angle in the hopper deviates more from the streamlines than in stationary shear flows . in the flowing parts of the silo 
 shear induced dilation is observed , which is more pronounced for elongated grains than for nearly spherical particles . 
 the clogged state is characterized by a dome , i. e. the geometry of the layer of grains blocking the outflow .

references",How do particle size and shape affect flow dynamics in granular material systems?,This question highlights a complex scientific phenomenon. It invites further exploration of the principles and mechanisms involved.," Particle size and shape significantly influence flow dynamics in granular material systems. Smaller particles generally flow faster than larger ones due to their smaller inertia. Additionally, particles with irregular shapes can cause more complex flow patterns and may be affected by collisions more readily than those with regular shapes. The shape of particles also affects the cohesion and adhesion forces between them, which can further influence the flow behavior. In granular media, particles often exhibit a mixture of these properties, leading to unique flow characteristics that differ from those of smooth fluids. Therefore, understanding how particle size and shape interact with flow dynamics is crucial for predicting and optimizing granular materials.<|im_end|>"," Particle size and shape significantly influence flow dynamics in granular material systems. Larger particles tend to aggregate more efficiently, reducing the overall flow resistance. Smaller particles can disperse more effectively, creating more chaotic flow patterns. Shape plays a crucial role in flow characteristics as it affects the drag force and the distribution of particles. For example, round particles are more efficient at frictional forces than squares, which can cause more erratic flow paths. Additionally, particles with different shapes can behave differently in response to changes in flow conditions, such as the formation of jets or swirls. Therefore, optimizing particle size and shape for specific applications is critical in granular flow simulations and industrial processes.<|im_end|>"
13,130615,"brownian motion in periodic potentials is one of standard models in condensed matter physics .
applications include the modeling of josephson junctions , polymer dynamics , superionic conduction , dielectric relaxation , plasma physics and surface diffusion  @xcite .
a detailed discussion and extensive bibliography can be found in  @xcite .
the goal of this paper is to study brownian motion in a tilted periodic potential for arbitrary values of the drift and of the tilt ( external forcing ) .
the dynamics of the brownian particle is governed by the langevin equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a periodic potential with period @xmath2 ( in each direction ) , @xmath3 denotes a constant external force , so that the effective potential is @xmath4 @xmath5 is the friction coefficient , @xmath6 is the inverse temperature and @xmath7 is a standard brownian motion on @xmath8 .
the main objective is the calculation of the drift and diffusion coefficients which are defined as @xmath9 and @xmath10 here @xmath11 denotes ensemble average and @xmath12 stands for the tensor product .
explicit formulas for these coefficients are available only in the overdamped limit and mostly in one dimension . an exact analytical formula for the effective velocity of an overdamped brownian particle moving in a one dimensional tilted periodic potential
was obtained many years ago by stratonovich  ( @xcite , ( * ? ? ?
9 ) ) . a corresponding analytical formula for the diffusion coefficient was obtained and analyzed more recently  @xcite , and verified in an experimental realization of the model involving rotating optical tweezers  @xcite .
simpler algebraic formulas were deduced from these for the special case of piecewise linear potentials in  @xcite .
only potentials with very specific geometries can lead to analytical formulas in dimension higher than one  @xcite .
a wealth of information on the problem of brownian motion in a tilted periodic potential in one dimension can be found in  ( * ? ? ?
it is well known that the equilibrium diffusion coefficient ( i.e. , the diffusion coefficient in the absence of an external drift ) and the drift , or , rather , the mobility are related through the famous einstein formula : @xmath13 with @xmath14 the validity of this formula has been proved rigorously for several models  @xcite , including that of a brownian particle in a tilted periodic potential  @xcite .
formulas of the form   can be understood in the more general framework of linear response theory and of the green - kubo formalism  @xcite .
a recent rigorous analysis of the green - kubo formalism for the calculation of the shear viscosity can be found in  @xcite .
the main goal of the present paper is to investigate the validity and usefulness of corrections to linear response theory . in particular , we calculate all terms in the power series expansions ( with respect to the forcing @xmath15 ) for the drift and diffusion coefficients and we use these in order to calculate corrections to einstein s formula  . our analysis is based on the formalism of averaging and homogenization  @xcite . from this formalism
we know that both drift and diffusion coefficients can be expressed in terms of the solution of appropriate poisson equations - .
details are presented in the next section .    for simplicity of notation and presentation
, we will restrict our calculations for corrections to linear response theory to the one dimensional case @xmath16 , and hence hereafter drop vector and tensor notation . completely analogous formulas are applicable in multiple dimensions .
we present our results in detail in section  [ sec : lin_resp ] , and summarize them here rather imprecisely :    [ prop : main ] the drift and diffusion coefficients admit the asymptotic expansions @xmath17 and    @xmath18 \\ & = & \beta^{-1 } \frac{d u}{df } + \sum_{\ell \geq 1 } f^{\ell } \sum_{n=1}^{\ell } \xi_{n \ell}. \ ] ]    the coefficients @xmath19 can be computed in terms of solutions to poisson equations for the generator of the equilibrium dynamics @xmath20 . in particular , the higher order corrections to the drift and diffusion coefficients are not compatible with an extension of the einstein relation ( [ e : einstein ] ) beyond the linear response regime @xmath21 .    for the case of a symmetric potential ( @xmath22 ) ,
then @xmath23 for even @xmath24 and @xmath25 for odd @xmath26 .
thus , it is possible , in principle , to calculate the drift and diffusion coefficients of the nonequilibrium dynamics   in terms of the equilibrium dynamics @xmath27 for at least a finite interval of values of @xmath15 .
the validity and usefulness of the power series expansions   is tested by performing numerical experiments . for the calculation of drift and diffusion coefficients
we need to solve poisson equations of the form @xmath28 with @xmath29 being the generator of the markov process @xmath30 with @xmath31 .
we solve equations of the form   using a spectral method  @xcite that is an extension of risken s continued fraction expansion method  @xcite . by comparing the results
obtained using our spectral method with results obtained from ( the computationally more expensive ) monte carlo simulations , we demonstrate that our method performs very well .
the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : lang ]
we present the formulas for the drift and diffusion coefficients obtained using homogenization theory . in section  [ sec : lin_resp ] we calculate the power series expansions for the drift and the diffusion coefficient . in section  [ sec : numerics ] we present results of numerical simulations on the calculation of @xmath32 and @xmath33 .
section  [ sec : conclusions ] summarizes our conclusions .
the details of the spectral method for the solution to the poisson equation are presented in appendix  [ sec : num_alg ] .
some discussion of how our formulas relate to an alternative approach developed in  @xcite can be found in appendix  [ sec : appmaes ] .
we start by writing   as a first order system , in @xmath16 dimension : @xmath34 the process @xmath30 is a markov process with generator @xmath35 the fokker - planck operator , i.e. the @xmath36adjoint of the generator , is @xmath37 the potential function @xmath38 has period @xmath39 .
we can use homogenization theory  @xcite to prove that the rescaled process @xmath40 where @xmath32 is the effective drift as defined below , converges weakly on @xmath41 ; { { \mathbb r   } } ) $ ] to a brownian motion with diffusion coefficient @xmath33 . to write down the formulas for the drift @xmath32 and the diffusion coefficient @xmath33 we need to consider the process @xmath42 defined on @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes a one - dimensional circle with length @xmath39 corresponding to the period of the potential @xmath45 .
the generator and fokker - planck operator of this process are still given by formulas   and   but now restricted on @xmath46 , with periodic boundary conditions with respect to @xmath47 .
it can be shown  @xcite that @xmath48 is an ergodic markov process with invariant measure @xmath49 that has a smooth density @xmath50 with respect to the lebesgue measure on @xmath46 .
the invariant density is the unique solution of the stationary fokker - planck equation on @xmath46 : @xmath51 the drift is then given by the average of the momentum with respect to @xmath52 over @xmath46 : @xmath53    the diffusion coefficient is given by the formula    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the solution of the poisson equation @xmath56 equations   and   are equipped with periodic boundary conditions in @xmath47 and suitable integrability conditions  @xcite .
formula  , which shows that the effective diffusion tensor is positive semidefinite , follows from   after an integration by parts .
it is possible to prove that both @xmath32 and @xmath33 are analytic functions of the forcing @xmath15 .
this has been proved for the drift in  @xcite ( in fact , in this paper the analyticity of the drift with respect to the forcing is proved for several models including systems of coupled fokker 
planck equations ) . a similar analysis can be used to prove the analytic dependence of @xmath33 on @xmath15 .
in this section we solve perturbatively equations   and   in one dimension , in order to obtain the power series expansions  . calculations of this form are quite standard when investigating the effect of colored noise on the drift and diffusion coefficients , e.g.  @xcite .
related calculations have presented recently in  @xcite .    the main result of this section is a precise formulation of proposition  [ prop : main ] .
to state the result , we need to introduce some notation .
we denote by @xmath57 the hamiltonian of the unperturbed ( equilibrium ) dynamics  : @xmath58 the invariant density of the unperturbed dynamics on @xmath46 is denoted by @xmath59 : @xmath60 we will work in the weighted @xmath36 space @xmath61 .
the inner product in this hilbert space will be denoted by @xmath62 .
the generator of the unperturbed dynamics can be written in the form @xmath63 where @xmath64 denote the reversible and irreversible parts , respectively .
the operators @xmath65 and @xmath66 are antisymmetric and symmetric , respectively , in @xmath67 .
we introduce now the creation and annihilation operators  @xcite @xmath68 these two operators are @xmath67-adjoint : @xmath69    [ prop : detailed ] the drift and diffusion coefficients admit the asymptotic expansions @xmath70 and    @xmath71 \\ & = & \beta^{-1 } \frac{d u}{df } + \sum_{\ell \geq 1 } f^{\ell } \sum_{n=1}^{\ell } \xi_{n \ell}. \label{e : deff_coeffs2}\end{aligned}\ ] ]    the coefficients @xmath72 are given by the formulas    @xmath73    where @xmath74 are solutions to the ( adjoint ) poisson equations    [ e : ll * ] @xmath75    we have used the notation @xmath76 to denote the @xmath67-adjoint of the generator @xmath77 .    the expansion formulas for the drift and velocity are consistent with the exact statistical reflection symmetry @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 in the stochastic system   or infinitesmal generator   when the potential is symmetric : @xmath81 .
since the drift is odd and the diffusivity even under reflection , this implies that the coefficients @xmath82 when @xmath26 is even and the coefficients @xmath25 when @xmath26 is odd .
one can verify that our formulas do indeed have these vanishing properties under symmetry of the potential , noting that the operators @xmath83 and @xmath84 are odd under reflection , whereas @xmath85 and @xmath86 are even . by uniqueness of solutions of the poisson equations   and the symmetry properties of the operators , inhomogeneity , and auxiliary conditions , we first verify by induction that the functions @xmath87 have even reflection symmetry for even @xmath88 and odd reflection symmetry for odd @xmath88 .
then we similarly induce that the functions @xmath89 have odd reflection symmetry for even @xmath90 and even reflection symmetry for odd @xmath88 . finally , @xmath91   has manifestly even symmetry under reflection symmetry .
therefore , when @xmath26 is even , @xmath92 can be checked to be the periodic integral of an odd function and when @xmath26 is odd , @xmath93 and @xmath94 are periodic integrals of odd functions , and so vanish .    using the notation that we have introduced in this section , einstein s formula ( linear response theory ) can be written in the form @xmath95 however , formula   shows that it is not true that a similar simple relation holds for higher order terms in the expansions for the drift and the diffusion coefficients .
in particular , * it is not true * that @xmath96 but instead there is a non - trivial correction to   that is given by the second term on the right hand side of  . as an example
, we present the formula for the diffusion coefficient that is valid up to @xmath97 : @xmath98 notice that the calculation of the next two terms in the expansion for the diffusion coefficient requires the solution of an additional poisson equation , in order to compute @xmath99 , as well as the calculation of three additional integrals .    similarly ,
* it is not true * that the einstein relation   can be extended away from @xmath100 in the form : @xmath101 because of the presence of correction terms in eq .  .
this issue is investigated numerically in the next section , see figures  [ u_linear_response ] and  [ d_linear_response ] .
the relation eq .
was indeed hypothesized in  @xcite , but  @xcite showed through analytical and numerical studies that while it seems qualitatively correct , and is quantitatively correct in the three limits @xmath21 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 , it is not quantitatively accurate for general parameter values .
our results in proposition  [ prop : detailed ] give quantitative formulas for this discrepancy , for example , through third order : @xmath104    the violation of the einstein relation for @xmath105 in the model under consideration , and other nonequilibrium steady - state models , was recently analyzed by  @xcite from a different nonperturbative perspective , expressing the correction terms with respect to various time - correlation functions of the dynamics .
but as we discuss in appendix  [ sec : appmaes ] , our framework based on perturbation expansions of the equations from homogenization theory appear to yield more easily computable expressions .
we remark also that  @xcite have examined deviations from the einstein relation in the context of stochastic tracer dynamics in a random environment .
_ proof of prop .
[ prop : detailed ] .
_ we start with the analysis of the stationary fokker - planck equation  .
we set @xmath106 we substitute   into   and use the symmetry and antisymmetry of @xmath66 and @xmath65 , respectively as well as equation   to obtain @xmath107 equation   is posed on @xmath108 and is equipped with periodic boundary conditions with respect to @xmath47 as well as the normalization condition @xmath109 we look for a solution to   as a power series expansion in @xmath15 : @xmath110 the normalization condition becomes @xmath111 this condition has to be satisfied for all @xmath112 which implies that the following normalization conditions should be satisfied @xmath113 we substitute the expansion for @xmath114 into   to obtain the sequence of equation    [ e : f_j_eqns ] @xmath115    the above equations are of the form @xmath116 the null space of @xmath117 , as well as its @xmath118-adjoint @xmath119 is one - dimensional and consists of constants .
consequently , the solvability condition for equations of the form is that @xmath120 provided that the solvability condition   is satisfied , the poisson equation   has a unique mean zero solution , @xmath121 .
we correspondingly define the operator @xmath122 on the subspace of functions satisfying   to be this unique mean zero solution .    from the first equation in   and the normalization condition
we deduce that @xmath123 the properties of the operators @xmath124 immediately yield that the solvability condition is satisfied for all equations for @xmath125 : @xmath126 the solution of equations   can be written as @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the @xmath129-adjoint of @xmath130 .
consequently , @xmath131    thus , we have obtained a power series expansion for the invariant distribution in powers of @xmath15 : @xmath132 from which we immediately deduce the expansion for the effective drift : @xmath133 in particular : @xmath134    now we proceed with the analysis of the poisson equation   which , in view of  ,  ,  , and   , can be written as @xmath135 with @xmath136 given by  . the generator of the perturbed dynamics is @xmath137 where @xmath119 is given by  .
we look for a solution of   in the form of a power series expansion in @xmath15 : @xmath138 we substitute this expansion into equation   to obtain the sequence of equations ( recalling from eq .
that @xmath139 ) :    [ e : phi_j_eqns ] @xmath140    equation   is precisely the poisson equation for the unperturbed dynamics @xmath141 .
now we show that the solvability condition   is satisfied for equations  .
we need to show that @xmath142    [ lemma : vel ] the solvability condition   is satisfied for all @xmath143 , and moreover the relation @xmath144 holds for all @xmath145 .
our strategy pivots on the observation that if we can establish ( [ eq : shiftphif ] ) for @xmath146 , then the solvability condition   follows for @xmath147 : @xmath148 using eq .
( [ eq : shiftphif ] ) with @xmath149 in the penultimate equality .
we now proceed to establish ( [ eq : shiftphif ] ) inductively for @xmath150 .
the case @xmath151 is trivial .
suppose now eq .  ( [ eq : shiftphif ] ) has been shown for all @xmath146 ; we will show that ( [ eq : shiftphif ] ) also follows for @xmath152 . to this end , it is useful to introduce the operator @xmath153 which projects orthogonally onto the hyperplane in @xmath154 orthogonal to constants : @xmath155 since , by the above argument and the induction hypothesis , the solvability condition for is satisfied for @xmath156 , we can write @xmath157 where the second sum of constants is included to meet the side condition in eq .
, as we have defined @xmath158 to yield a mean zero solution .
but the operator @xmath159 will kill these constants , and therefore , for @xmath160 , we can write : @xmath161 in the penultimate equality , we used @xmath162 from the fact that by definition of @xmath163 , @xmath164 ; the final equality follows from the induction hypothesis .
now we derive  . using the centering condition in
we have that the diffusion coefficient is given by @xmath165 \\ & = &   \sum_{r=0}^{\infty }   f^r \left[\beta^{-1 } \langle \phi_r , a^{+ } \boldsymbol{1}\rangle_{\beta } + \sum_{n=1}^{r }   \int_{{{\mathbb x } } } \ ! p \ , \phi_{r - n } \ , f_{n } \bar{\rho } \ , dp dq\right ] \\
& = &   \sum_{r=0}^{\infty }   f^r \left[\beta^{-1 } v_{r+1 } + \sum_{n=1}^{r } \sigma_{nr}\right],\end{aligned}\ ] ] yielding ( [ e : deff_coeffs1 ] ) .
we can also alternatively restructure this expansion as follows , using the relations and : @xmath166 \\      & = & \beta^{-1 } \sum_{r=0}^{\infty } f^r \sum_{n=0}^{r } \left[\langle a^{-}\phi_r , f_{0 } \rangle_{\beta } +       \langle \phi_{r - n},a^{- } f_{n } \rangle_{\beta}\right ]       \\      & = & \beta^{-1 } \sum_{r=0}^{\infty } f^{r }       \sum_{n=0}^{r } \left [   v_{r+1 } +    \langle \phi_{r - n},a^{- } f_{n } \rangle_{\beta}\right ] \\   & = & \beta^{-1 } \sum_{r=0}^{\infty } f^{r }      \left[(r+1 ) v_{r+1 } +   \sum_{n=0}^{r }   \langle \phi_{r - n},a^{- } f_{n } \rangle_{\beta}\right ] \\      & = & \beta^{-1 } \frac{d u}{d f } +        \sum_{r=1}^{\infty } f^r \sum_{n=1}^{r } \xi_{nr } ,           \end{aligned}\ ] ] establishing the statement   in the proposition . in the last equality
, we used that @xmath167 .     as a function of @xmath15 for @xmath168 , @xmath169 and @xmath170 .
* markers * : monte carlo estimates
. other parameters of the simulations are @xmath171 , @xmath172 , and @xmath173 . following convention , the force variable is scaled by the critical force @xmath174 at which the effective potential   becomes monotonic , and the drift is scaled by the value @xmath175 it would have in absence of the periodic potential @xmath176 .
for the monte carlo simulations we use an euler - maruyama scheme with a time step @xmath177 integrating over @xmath178 time steps ( after @xmath179 time steps of a transient integration interval ) and averaging over @xmath180 trajectories.,scaledwidth=95.0% ]     as a function of @xmath15 for @xmath168 , @xmath169 and @xmath170 . * markers * : monte carlo estimates .
parameters of the simulations are as in figure 1 , with diffusivity now scaled by the value @xmath181 it would have in absence of the periodic potential @xmath182 . ,
in this section we present results of numerical simulations that corroborate the theoretical results presented in the previous section .
the calculation of the drift and diffusion coefficients is based on the numerical solution of the hypoelliptic boundary value problems   and   as well as the calculation of the integrals   and  .
both pdes are solved using a spectral method that relies on the expansion of the solution of the stationary fokker - planck and the poisson equations in a fourier - hermite expansion .
this method is adapted from risken s continued fraction expansion method  @xcite ; see also  @xcite .
this method was used previously in the study of the diffusion coefficient for a brownian particle in a periodic potential in  @xcite .
details about the numerical method can be found in appendix  [ sec : num_alg ] .    [ cols=""^ "" , ]     [ fig : overdamped_approx_d ]
using the framework of homogenization theory and multiscale analysis , we have developed a systematic expansion of the effective drift and effective diffusivity for the nonequilibrium dynamics of a particle in a tilted periodic potential .
the coefficients in this expansion relate the nonequilibrium transport coefficients to statistical averages involving the equilibrium dynamics ( with no imposed tilt ) , computed through the solutions of boundary value problems for deterministic partial differential equations of hypoelliptic type .
the expansions give a detailed description of how einstein s relation between the diffusivity and mobility of a particle is violated in higher orders with respect to the perturbation from equilibrium .
our theoretical results were confirmed by numerical simulations based on a new efficient spectral method for the solution of poisson equations for the generator of the langevin dynamics .
our method of analysis can be readily extended , with suitable elaboration of notation , to multiple dimensions .
other substantial directions for future research include the application of the homogenization procedure to multiscale and locally periodic potentials , as well as to time - dependent external forcing .
this last setting could have particular relevance to the study of stochastic resonance phenomena .    *

in this appendix we present a numerical approach for solving the 1-dimensional stationary fokker - planck equation together with the cell problem for computing @xmath1 and @xmath33 via and .
this numerical method is based on the approach by @xcite and consists in a spectral decomposition of the solution of ( [ e : fp_station ] ) and in terms of hermite polynomials and fourier series , followed by a recursive method to solve the resulting system of algebraic equations . since
this approach is presented in @xcite for finding numerically @xmath183 and @xmath32 , we will focus on the computation of @xmath33 via the solution for the auxiliary field @xmath184 in equation ( ) and equation ( [ e : deff ] ) .      the cell problem for the auxiliary field @xmath184
can be written in terms of the infinitesimal generator of the ornstein - uhlenbeck ( ou ) process as introduced in section [ sec : lin_resp ] , @xmath185 as @xmath186 with @xmath32 the effective drift as given by .
note that the invariant distribution @xmath187 of the ou process , @xmath188 , implies @xmath189 . in view of the structure of the previous equation , we use the following representation for its solution , @xmath190 where @xmath191 is a series of functions to be determined .
@xmath192 are rescaled hermite polynomials @xmath193 which are the eigenfunctions of the operator @xmath66 , @xmath194 also , these rescaled hermite polynomials are orthonormal with respect to the unperturbed stationary distribution : @xmath195 and satisfy the relations : @xmath196 upon substituting ( [ sol_cell ] ) into ( ) , projecting against @xmath197 , @xmath198 , and @xmath199 for @xmath200 respectively , and using the orthonormality property of the hermite polynomials , we obtain the following infinite system of ordinary differential equations for @xmath191 , @xmath201 for @xmath202      since the solution to the cell problem must be periodic in @xmath47 , the auxiliary functions @xmath191 must also be periodic .
it is natural then to express these functions in terms of their fourier series , @xmath203 for simplicity , we will focus now on the simplest periodic potential , namely , @xmath204 although more complex potentials can be studied . in terms of this potential ,
the equations take the following form , @xmath205      we now proceed to describe the numerical algorithm for computing @xmath33 . in order to solve in its spectral representation ( [ spectral ] ) , we approximate @xmath191 by a galerkin truncation of the fourier series after the @xmath207th term , @xmath208 the infinite system of algebraic equations ( [ spectral ] ) becomes then an infinite , tri - diagonal system of equations expressed as follows . by explicitly writing the real and imaginary parts of @xmath209 and using the fact that the solution must be real - valued ( which implies that @xmath210 and @xmath211 ) we form the vectors , @xmath212 this representation leads to the following system of equations ,    @xmath213    these matrices
are given , for @xmath214 , by , @xmath215 where @xmath216 is the @xmath217 x @xmath217 identity matrix .
for @xmath218 we have , @xmath219 @xmath220 @xmath221 @xmath222 @xmath223 @xmath224_k=\sqrt{\beta}\,u\delta_{k,1 } , \quad [ \boldsymbol{a}]_k=-\delta_{k,1},\ ] ] where @xmath225_k$ ] represents the @xmath217th element of the vector @xmath226 ( respectively for @xmath227 . )
in order to solve the infinite system of algebraic equations , we impose some boundary condition of the form @xmath228 , for large @xmath229 .
tested boundary conditions include @xmath230 ( dirichlet boundary condition ) , which we employed in the simulations in section  [ sec : numerics ] , and @xmath231 ( neumann boundary condition ) . defining matrices @xmath232 recursively
downwards from @xmath233 by @xmath234 we can check by induction ( again downwards ) that for @xmath235 , @xmath236 indeed , this relation is already in force for @xmath237 , and assuming it to be true for some @xmath238 , from eq .
we find : @xmath239 so that eq
.   holds for @xmath240 as well .
turning now to eqs .   and
, we have    @xmath241    from which we find by solving for @xmath242 in terms of @xmath243 : @xmath244 substituting this expression into eq .  , we finally obtain a closed equation for @xmath243 : @xmath245 the matrix @xmath246 will have one null eigenvalue ( corresponding to the null space of @xmath29 ) .
one can verify , by considering the analogous numerical solution scheme for @xmath247 and @xmath248 , presented in  @xcite , that the right hand side of eq .
satisfies the solvability condition that it be orthogonal to the left eigenvector of @xmath249 with zero eigenvalue . a unique solution for @xmath243
is then obtained by discretization of the auxiliary condition in eq .  .
in particular , representing the solution to the stationary fokker - planck ( [ e : fp_station ] ) by a hermite polynomial expansion @xmath250 and approximating the functions @xmath251 by a finite fourier series , with coefficients organized into vectors @xmath252 analogously to eq .  , this auxiliary condition reads : @xmath253_1 \big)= 0.\ ] ] this then determines , with eq .
, @xmath254 from which he remaining @xmath255 are found recursively using the matrices @xmath256 and the relations  .
once the vectors @xmath257 are found , @xmath33 is easily computed by replacing the proposed solution for @xmath258 and @xmath184 in ( [ e : deff ] ) and using the hermite polynomial properties to obtain : @xmath259_1 + 2\boldsymbol{r}_{n}^t\boldsymbol{\phi}_{n+1 }   -[\boldsymbol{r}_{n}^t\boldsymbol{\phi}_{n+1}]_1\big ) \end{array}\ ] ]
the relation between the diffusivity and mobility is expressed in  @xcite as follows ( in our notation ) : @xmath260 where @xmath261 and @xmath262 denotes an average over the stochastic noise ( and possibly random initial conditions ) .
the correction term was studied in  @xcite on the model system ( [ e : langevin_intro ] ) as well as other non - equilibrium systems through direct numerical simulation of the governing dynamical equations and monte carlo estimation of the statistical average .
we can express eq .   in terms of deterministic operators through the following formal manipulations .
first , we re - express @xmath263 which avoids the complication of working with the nonperiodic variable @xmath264 .
we then have : @xmath265 now , thanks to the large factor of @xmath266 in the denominator , we may neglect initial transients and evaluate the statistical average in the nonequilibrium steady state , i.e. , with single - time statistics governed by the invariant density @xmath267 , the solution of the stationary fokker - planck equation .

using now the nonpositivity of the operator @xmath273 and the fact that @xmath274 since @xmath275 projects onto the subspace orthogonal to the kernel of @xmath276 , the @xmath277 adjoint of @xmath273 , we can evaluate the @xmath278 limit to obtain the following formal operator - theoretic equivalent to the formula eq .   from  @xcite : @xmath279 .

for the correction to the einstein relation , we see that beyond computing @xmath247 as the stationary solution of the fokker - planck equation  , we must solve a poisson equation of the form   as well as a second poisson equation of the form @xmath285 in the expression eq .
, we must solve a stationary fokker - planck equation  , a poisson equation of the form  , as well as an adjoint - poisson equation of the form @xmath286 in both cases , it seems that an additional equation would need to be solved beyond the stationary fokker - planck equation   and a single poisson equation   necessary in the homogenization approach . on the other hand ,
computing the mobility @xmath287 at general values of the tilt @xmath288 from the nonperturbative homogenization equations would require a differentiation between different values of @xmath289 .
the direct formula   would generally of course need to be evaluated through monte carlo averages involving a large number of sample trajectories run for sufficiently long .
the perturbation theory with respect to @xmath289 developed for the homogenization equations in section  [ sec : lin_resp ] has the virtue of allowing the simultaneous numerical computation of the diffusivity and drift for a range of values of tilt @xmath289 , rather than one value at a time .
one could introduce similar perturbation expansions with respect to tilt @xmath289 into the formulas   and  .
we attempted to examine whether this would give equivalent results , but found this effort frustrating . on the one hand ,
computing eq .
perturbatively would introduce the perturbative series solution to a second poisson equation completely absent from the homogenization theory , so it would be difficult to relate the results .

however , implementing the perturbation expansion on eq .

the main complication is the propagation of the perturbation expansion   for the invariant density through the adjoint operator @xmath293  .
perhaps a more clever analysis would provide a linkage between the formula for the correction   to the einstein relation from  @xcite and the perturbative expansion we have developed in proposition  [ prop : detailed ] , but it appears that computations are considerably simpler by conducting the perturbation expansion on the homogenization equations as we have done in section  [ sec : lin_resp ] .

alternative approach to obtaining corrections to einsteins formula",What impact do periodic potentials have on the efficiency of molecular transport systems?,"Periodic potentials create energy landscapes that guide particle motion. In molecular transport systems, they enhance directional flow while reducing randomness, optimizing efficiency in processes like diffusion."," Periodic potentials can significantly enhance the efficiency of molecular transport systems by altering the dynamics of molecules through their periodic structure. By creating localized regions with alternating signs or phases, periodic potentials can trap and redistribute molecules more efficiently than uniform or homogeneous potentials. This localized behavior helps molecules to maintain a higher concentration at certain points, which can then be transported more easily. Additionally, periodic potentials can provide a barrier for molecules that might otherwise escape, further enhancing their transport efficiency. The use of periodic potentials in molecular simulations has been shown to improve the accuracy and reliability of transport predictions, particularly in cases where the transport process involves complex interactions between molecules and the environment. Therefore, the incorporation of periodic potentials into molecular transport models is an important area of research and development.<|im_end|>","The impact of periodic potentials on the efficiency of molecular transport systems can be analyzed through several aspects, focusing on how these potentials affect the dynamics of molecules and the overall transport processes. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Effect on Molecular Dynamics**: Periodic potentials introduce periodic forces that influence the motion of molecules. These forces can cause molecules to move more chaotically, potentially disrupting the regular patterns of molecular transport that are characteristic of molecular dynamics simulations.

2. **Reduced Efficiency**: By introducing periodic forces, the molecular transport systems may experience reduced efficiency. This is because the chaotic motion induced by the periodic forces can lead to increased collisions between molecules, which can decrease the overall transport rate. Additionally, the irregular movement of molecules can create obstacles that hinder their progress through the system.

3. **Potential Energy Minimization**: While periodic potentials can sometimes serve as a means of energy minimization in certain applications, they can also introduce artifacts that can complicate the analysis and hinder the optimization of molecular"
16,27421,"internal line shifts in quasar spectra have played an ever - increasing role in our understanding of quasar structure and dynamics .
apart from early attempts to explain quasar cosmological redshifts as intrinsic to the quasar ( see e.g. , the historical account in chapter 2 of * ? ? ?
* ) that lead to serious inconsistency @xcite , the realization that all lines in a quasar do not yield the same redshift was slow to come . until the early 1980s and the pioneering paper by martin gaskell @xcite _ redshift difference between emission lines had not been systematically studied in quasars , _ even if some cases of broad line shifts ( @xmath0 with respect to narrow lines ) had been noted in seyfert galaxies @xcite .
gaskell s results on the difference between low- and high - ionization lines ( lils and hils , represented by  and  respectively ) have remained valid since then , and have yielded the observational basis for a model that is still today providing a basic interpretative sketch for the structure of the broad line emitting region @xcite . in that model ,
hil blue shifts are associated with radial motion in a flattened structure ( the accretion disk ) emitting mainly lils .
later developments @xcite confirmed the earlier results .
@xcite suggested that results were not the same for all quasars , and that a first distinction between radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars was necessary : blueshifts were mostly present in radio quiet ( rq ) quasars , but definitely rarer or of lower amplitudes in radio loud ( rl ) .
this finding ( confirmed in @xcite and @xcite ) has been further contextualised within the pop . a and b concept in the 4d eigenvector 1 formalism ( e.g. * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
. in the following we will focus attention on the  line , as representative of lils , and its contextualization within 4de1 (  [ 4de1 ] ) .
we report the observational properties in a systematic way (  [ phen ] ) that includes a robust empirical interpretation based on nebular physics (  [ ei ] ) , and effects of luminosity and radio loudness (  [ effects ] ) .
we then discuss the physical processes that may be relevant in line profile broadening (  [ physics ] ) .
we conclude with remarks on unknown aspects and desiderata for further observations (  [ build ] and   [ open ] ) .
the ( 4d ) eigenvector 1 quasar contextualization scheme at low-@xmath1 offers a powerful tool for interpretation of the   emission line ( and of lils in general ) profiles .
eigenvector 1 was originally defined from a principal component analysis ( pca ) of 87 pg quasars involving an anticorrelation between optical feii intensity , half - maximum profile width of   and peak intensity of  @xcite .
e1 was afterwards expanded to 4de1 with the addition of x - ray photon index and  profile shift measures @xcite .
4de1 allows one to define a quasar main sequence in 4de1 space @xcite .
the principle parameters of the 4de1 space are :    * full width at half maximum of broad  ( fwhm ) which is our diagnostic low ionization lines observable from the ground out to z @xmath2 0.9 with optical and ( intermittently to @xmath3 ) with infrared spectroscopy .
it ( and/or fwhm ) is thought to be a measure of assumed virialized motions in the ad and is thus crucial for estimating black hole masses for large samples of quasars .
* ratio of the equivalent width of the 4570   optical feii blend and broad  (= w 4570 feii blend / w ) .
it is sensitive to the ionization state , the electron density and column density of the blr gas arising , as far as we can tell , in ( at least part of ) the gas that produces  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
* centroid shift at fwhm of the high ionization line  ( at half , maximum , c(1/2 ) ) .
it is a strong diagnostic of winds / outflows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
* soft x - ray photon index ( ) .
most likely an indicator of optically thick comptonized radiation , and probably a diagnostic of the thermal emission from the ad or of a compton - thick corona above the disk @xcite .
the 4de1 approach allows the definition of spectral types following source occupation in the optical 4de1 plane fwhm(h@xmath4 ) vs  @xcite and can be extended to include all four dimensions ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * for ) .
it is possible to identify two populations along the sequence : population a with fwhm(h@xmath4)@xmath5 , and a second population b of sources with broader lines ( see * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
* for the rationale behind two distinct quasar populations ) .
it is customary to distinguish between broad and narrow components of balmer lines , with type 1 agn showing a non - zero broad component ( the case closest to type 2 is type 1.9 , for which the bc is visible in  but not in * ? ? ?
it is widely believed that the emitting region of these sources suffers heavy obscuration @xcite . in some cases  but apparently not in all sources @xcite  a bc becomes visible in polarised light . in the following we restrict attention to sources that do not show strong evidence of obscuration in their line profiles ( i.e. , we will exclude type 1.5 , 1.8 and 1.9 sources of the old osterbrock s classification ) .        before 4de1
, several workers provided excellent data on   ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) but their interpretation was limited by the lack of any contextualization . without contextualization
every quasar is an island under itself without a clear understanding of how it fits into the general population .
the fwhm  distribution is puzzling since its includes profiles over a very wide range of widths , from less than 1000 to more than 20000 .
these line width limits can be related to physical processes , although under several assumptions @xcite that may be justified only after a first organization of empirical properties is accomplished . a first attempt to describe in a systematic way the shape of broad lines in low-@xmath1  quasars devised a qualitative assignment based on peak shift and shape asymmetry : for example , a redward asymmetric profile with a redshifted peak would be classified as ar , r , a symmetric unshifted as s , etc . @xcite .
this and more quantitative analyses of the line wing shape stressed the systematic changes occurring in large samples @xcite
. further work of our group involved the analysis of observations collected over a decade and presented in @xcite .
results from the analysis of those data were later confirmed by a larger sample of 470 bright quasars from sdss dr5 @xcite .
the main findings can be summarised as follows :    * there is a trend in  line profile properties that is correlated with the 4de1 sequence @xcite .
line profile shapes change along the sequence , from a lorentzian with a blue shifted excess at the line base to a redward asymmetric profile best fit with 2 gaussian components .
the latter profile is typical of the larger fwhm @xmath6 .
[ fig : e1 ] shows the spectral types at the opposite ends of the sequence . in spectral type a4 ( at the high feii end of the 4ed1 sequence )
the blue excess of  is especially evident , as the shallow , redward very broad profile is for b1++ ( at the opposite end of the sequence , with broadest lines and very weak feii emission ) . * peculiar , double- or multiple peaked profiles are more frequent toward the extreme pop .
b spectral types i.e. , b1++ with fwhm ( ) @xmath7 12000 .
* radio loud sources are predominantly pop .
b @xcite ; radio core - dominated ( cd ) sources show systematically narrower profiles ( and distribute in 4de1 spaced like radio - quiet sources ) , while lobe - dominated ( ld assumed to be fanaroff - riley ii , frii ) are frequently associated with very broad profiles ( almost exclusively population b ) .
peculiar profiles can be empirically grouped in three large categories : ( 1 ) double peaked profiles with small peak separation ( @xmath8 ) .
these sources are apparently rare , since only a handful are known .
we stress the apparently since some cases could be masked by the blending of  and .
prototypes include akn 120 , ic 4329a , and ox 169 @xcite ; ( 2 ) wide separation double peaked profiles ( @xmath9 ) , whose prototype are arp 120b and 3c 390.3 @xcite .
an example is shown in fig .
[ fig : pec ] .
( 3 ) single peaked profiles with a large shift , either to the blue or to the red ( two examples , one for each case , are also shown in fig .
[ fig : pec ] ) .
a prototypical source , mkn 668 @xcite , shows a peak displacement of @xmath10 .
@xcite found that class ( 2 ) profiles are also relatively rare ( @xmath11% , considering that most of the @xcite sources are not actually double - peaked sources ) . the prevalence is higher among rl but significant also among rq sources .
attempts at interpretation of single emission lines are doomed to provide rather ambiguous results .
the emitting region is not spatially resolved , and the profiles are usually smooth
. they can be described by simple functional forms ( logarithmic , or lorentzian ) , and these profile can be modelled assuming widely different structural and dynamical conditions . on the converse , comparison of representative hils to representative lils (  and )
provides important insights @xcite .
some  profiles show a significant excess with respect to a symmetric lorentzian especially in the spectral types associated with the highest  @xcite .
the blue shifted emission has been interpreted as an outflowing component which has a physical correspondence if there is e.g. a non - rotating radiation driven wind @xcite .
further interpretation of the broad profiles involves `` stratification '' of the emitting region : we associate ( likely an over - simplification of a continuous radial trend ) the broad component with a lower ionization broad line region ( blr ) , where line broadening is predominantly virial , and where ,  are also emitted ( * ? ? ?
* and references therein ) .
consistently , there is no significant shift ( @xmath12 ) between  bc and  optical emission @xcite .
the very broad component is associated with an inner region of higher ionization , the very broad line region ( vblr ) emitting no  and showing lower continuum responsivity @xcite .
the typical decomposition bc / vbc is shown by the mock profile in fig . [ fig : mock ] as well as by the composite profile in fig .
[ fig : e1 ] .
lil profiles often show asymmetries but the amplitude of the asymmetries and shifts is usually much less than their fwhm @xcite .
the stratification view is consistent with virial motions dominating both the core and the wings of the pop .
b lils , although the redward asymmetry of balmer and other lils is difficult to explain .     @xmath13 . ]    , and the centroids ( black spots ) at different fractional intensities on the _ full _ profile , to obtain a quantitative parameterisation that is independent of the decomposition of the profile .

, title=""fig : "" ]      the main luminosity effect on  is a systematic increase in the minimum fwhm @xcite which has been shown in several papers since 2009 and will not be shown again . at the same time
we see that shifts toward the red close to the line base , at 1/4 fractional intensity become more frequent in higher @xmath14  sources ( this is reflected in an increased redward asymmetry ) . at present
we do not see any strong rl effect on .

extreme cases of redward asymmetry are found among radio loud quasars but there is no doubt that pop .
b rq sources are also capable of impressive redward asymmetries ( especially at high luminosity ) with ai@xmath2 0.5 .
most of the quasars in our high @xmath14   sample @xcite are rq quasars ( fig .
[ fig : lum ] ) .
as mentioned , rl effects on lils can be viewed as second order , if they exist at all . in the plane c(1/4 ) vs fwhm  the bulk of the radio loud sources occupies the same area of rq pop .
b , with some cds trespassing to the pop . a side , most likely because of an orientation effect , as they are viewed close to the radio axis ( fig .

b rq and rl , if measurements uncertainties are taken into account ( lower panel of fig .
[ fig : par ] ) .
there is no correlation with radio - loudness parameters .
the panels of fig .
[ fig : rl ] shows that the  ai does not depend neither on  nor on specific radio power .
the behaviour of lils is definitely different from the one of hils , where the suppression of  blueshifts occurs mainly in rl sources , making the redward asymmetry associated with the vbc more prominent . in rq sources ,
the redward asymmetry is masked by some blue shifted emission .
the vblr is believed by some to be a source of strong  emission @xcite .
the difference between the  and  profiles can be explained , at least in part , by adding blue shifted  emission in rq sources .
represent the sample of @xcite .
the shaded band width is set by the uncertainty at a @xmath15  confidence level in individual ai measurements . within this band
, profiles can be considered symmetric . ]
line broadening and shifts can be produced because of particular physical conditions , for example , for a medium at very high pressure such as in white dwarf atmospheres ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) by quantum mechanical effects @xcite .
such shifts are however rather modest even at the highest density . generally speaking natural and collisional broadening
produce lorentzian profiles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?
we find many balmer line profiles in pop .
a sources that are lorentzian - like ( to be more precise , they are voigt due to the convolution with the ( gaussian ) instrumental profile ) .
the width is however too large to be produced by collisional effects ; lorentzian profiles are possible also for processes associated with gas motion and geometry .    in principle ,
thermal broadening could yield a gaussian line with fwhm@xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the boltzmann constant @xmath18  the electron temperature , @xmath19  the electron mass , and @xmath20  the line rest frame wavelength . for a typical fwhm  = 4000 , the electron temperature needs to be @xmath21 k , too high .
optical depth effects may also produce shifts and absorptions dips in the emission profiles .
narrow dips and not widely - spaced double peaks are sometimes observed in  profiles ( typical cases : ic 4329a , akn 120 , and ox 169 @xcite ) , but optical depth effects are usually not considered as a possible cause of the absorption , even if the balmer line optical depth is @xmath22 .
self - absorption requires that the emitting gas cloud is seen through the line of sight @xcite , which may occur occasionally but not very frequently ( a case known for many years involves the  profile of ngc 4151 , @xcite ) .
accordingly , only a few cases of   bal profiles are known ( e.g. , * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
* and references therein ) .
the rarity of these sources is most likely a consequence of the physical conditions needed to produce significant absorption : the maintenance of a large population of hi atoms with electrons excited to level @xmath23 via  resonance scattering , so that the @xmath23  level can become a pseudo - ground level and  itself `` behave '' like a resonant line .

, title=""fig : "" ]      the blr is believed to be optically thin for electron scattering @xcite .
however it is still possible that broad line photons are scattered by hot electron surrounding or embedding the line emitting gas @xcite , as in the case of an hot inter cloud medium or of an ionised atmosphere above a dense accretion disk .
support for the latter hypothesis has been found by spectropolarimetric analysis of the broad  profile : in about ten objects , the pa of the polarisation vector rotates across the profile , reaching opposite pa in the red and blue wings @xcite , as expected if light is scattered from a rotating disk . since the emitting region radius
is now believed to be much smaller than in the past ( the inner radius might be less than 100 ) , it is possible that the innermost broad line emission , already associated with gas in rapid motion , is further broadened by a screen of hot electrons @xcite .
it is intriguing that @xcite found lower polarisation in the line core .
this is consistent with a two component model ( i.e. , bc + vbc ) where the core is emitted further out than the line wings , possibly outside of the screen of scattering material .
other scattering processes might be operating as well .
rayleigh scattering could be relevant if there is neutral material of high column density , as might be present in an accretion disk or a molecular torus
. it could be more important than electron scattering in the uv @xcite .
rayleigh scattering could contribute the broadening of the extended line wings in  if  is emitted above the disk and scattered towards the observer by the dense accretion disk @xcite .
fast ( relativistic ) electrons moving in a dense medium could be give rise to cerenkov line - like radiation @xcite .
densities above @xmath26 @xmath27 3 are required for a significant effect .
this may be the case for an accretion disk as well as for dense gas clumps emitting the lils in extreme population a sources @xcite .
shifts on the order of @xmath28should appear as a net redshift in the balmer and lyman lines @xcite .
an early analysis of gravitational redshift in the context of broad line emission was given by @xcite .
a detailed discussion of gravitational redshift effects on the balmer line profiles is provided by bon et al .
( submitted for this volume ) .
here we just recall that gravitation can induce a shift   @xmath29 where @xmath30  is the black hole mass , and @xmath31  the schwarzschild radius ( @xmath32 ) .
this relation is valid with an approximation of 4%  down to a 20 schwarzschild radii .
the total shift of line profiles would include the effect of transverse doppler redshift , so that the expected shift is @xmath33 .
two considerations are in order :    * the most massive bhs may be associated with the strongest red - ward asymmetries in the   line @xcite ; * ray tracing in kerr metrics produce red wings that reproduce fairly well the observations of observed profiles in several high - luminosity sources .    is this enough to justify the claim that grav @xmath1  produces the redward asymmetry in pop .
b sources ?
the answer is `` no '' .
the problem is that the models assume disk emission with steep emissivity laws that give a significant weight to the inner disk regions .
since the radii needed to explain the centroid shifts at 1/4 or the vbc displacements are @xmath34 100 @xmath35 , there is not likely to be enough cold gas to explain the most luminous sources . a more detailed model that includes both kinematics and emitting gas physical conditions ( assuming , for instance , that the gas in confined to a dense disk ) is needed before a conclusion can be reached ( bon et al . ) .
there are several lines of evidence supporting virial motion as an important source of line broadening :    * velocity resolved reverberation mapping studies @xcite exclude outflows as the broadening source at least in the lils of population b sources . *
an anti - correlation between size ( derived from reverberation mapping ) and line width found for several lines in the same sources @xcite : a central massive object gravitationally dominates cloud motions , with the lines emitted by ionic species of higher ionization potential due to gas moving faster , and emitted closer to the central massive object . *
a fairly symmetric profile is by far the most frequent ; apart from the peculiar cases , shifts are usually less than 0.1 of the line width at the same fractional height @xcite . *  and
show a trend in line width consistent with the domination of virial motions .
is preferentially emitted at slightly larger distance than  from the continuum source @xcite ; * there is a gradient in ionization level ( approximated in the decomposition blr / vblr ) that is consistent with a virial velocity field .
extreme population a sources ( spectral type a3 and a4 ) often show a blue - shifted excess indicative of radial motion and most likely associated with an outflow .
this said , the geometry of the gas is not yet clear .
the fundamental issue of whether the gas is associated with a disk or with a system of clouds is still not settled .
clouds models are still formulated at the time of writing perhaps by authors unaware of the confinement problems that cloud models face @xcite , of which the most serious remains the expected decay time due to the viscous attrition with some putative `` inter cloud medium . ''
disk + wind models provide some consistency with ideas about pop .
b sources @xcite , but they still fail to reproduce a typical pop .
b  profile . at the same time , a lorentzian profile might be reasonably associated with an extended disk , but other models can also produce lorentzian or almost lorentzian shapes , most notably a system of clouds under the combined influence of gravity and radiation pressure forces @xcite .
[ [ binary - bh ] ] binary bh + + + + + + + + +    the search for binary black holes is still in its infancy .
apart from a few very special cases such as oj 287 @xcite , evidence in favour of sub - parsec binaries that could significantly affect the broad line profiles is still sparse , and has been hard to find @xcite .
some of the most classical double peaked sources ( arp 102b , @xcite ) show remarkable stability of the peak positions over decades , ruling out a binary system with reasonable masses @xcite .
similar considerations were made for ox 169 @xcite .
sub - pc bbh should be numerous at high @xmath1 but rarer in the local universe @xcite .
it is still unclear whether we should look for a sizeable minority population or for extremely rare event , as coalescence times depend on the evolution of the binary orbit eccentricity , and circularised orbit are  stiff "" since they do not yield to orbital losses due to gravitational radiation .
profiles with large shifts are perhaps more promising @xcite , and extensive searches for eventual monitoring are being carried out ( e.g. , * ? ? ?
* ) .    the accretion disk explanation that fits arp 102b so well fails for other double peaked sources for which a more suitable model may be offered by elliptical disks @xcite .
accretion disk emission has been postulated for the broad line wings @xcite .
modelling of a disk may require abandoning the weak field treatment in order to model the red asymmetry of balmer line profiles in pop .
b ( bon et al . submitted ) .
single peaked profiles with large shift can be explained by radially moving gas .
however , inferences on the direction of radial motions are affected by isotropy of line emission : if the line is anisotropically emitted as expected for the balmer lines in the physical conditions of the blr @xcite , then a redshift corresponds to inflow ( accretion ? ) , and a blueshift to outflow ( winds ? ) , although it is still possible that we see emission mainly from the shielded face of clouds @xcite .
line profiles of balmer lines are orientation dependent .
this result emerges on a statistical basis by comparing the average line widths of lobe - dominated and core - dominated radio - loud sources @xcite .
conservation of angular momentum accounts for the the spherical symmetry break that leads to the formation of a keplerian ( or quasi - keplerian ) accretion disk around the black hole .
not surprisingly , a flattened configuration was already `` in place '' in the minds of astronomers from heuristic considerations during the 1970s ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .
however , the viewing angle is a parameter that is generally unknown for rq sources and can be estimated only for superluminal radio loud sources on an individual basis @xcite .
approaches using polarimetry @xcite and gravitational redshift ( if found appropriate ) can in principle lead to an estimate of the viewing angle @xcite . a flattened or a `` bowl''-shaped geometry @xcite is suggested by the dependence of line width on viewing angle .
@xcite suggested that line emission may occur in the outer region of the accretion disk , where it should merge with the surrounding molecular torus , and were able to obtain lorentzian profiles for the integrated emission from that region .
this model is intriguing and may well be applicable to extreme pop . a sources .
heuristic considerations and black hole and eddington ratio estimates suggest that the main driver of the quasar main sequence is eddington ratio ( e.g. , * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
population a and b are distinct in terms of eddington ratio : the boundary value ( for bh mass of 10@xmath36 ) is estimated to be @xmath37 @xcite .
it is interesting to note that this is the limit at which the transition from a geometrically thin to a geometrically thick disk is expected ( * ? ? ?
* ; * ? ? ?
* and references therein ) .
so , any model of the blr should be based on this constraint , with models valid for pop .
a including a geometrically thick disk , its anisotropy and shadowing effects .
a first attempt to include a geometrically thick disk in a blr model has been carried out by @xcite , but the predictions until now contradict the observations .
it is perhaps disappointing that after 40 years of effort the structure and dynamics of the regions emitting the lils are poorly understood .
however , on the bright side , some key points have been clarified :    * we now have a contextualization which allows us to relate , and discriminate between source classes ; * a trend in balmer line shapes is systematic along the 4de1 sequence ; * lorentzian ( pop .
a ) or double gaussian ( pop .
b ) are by far the most frequent  and  profiles ; * only a minority of sources show very broad profiles that are immediately consistent with accretion disk emission ; * the wide range of hil fwhm suggests that black hole mass estimates using this measure as a virial estimator must be treated with caution .
no model can explain this range invoking only line of sight orientation of a flattened disk .
the rules for mass estimation are likely different for pop .
a and b sources .
degeneracy of the regular profile with respect to competing models is still a major problem .
knowing however that  is a major driver in hil profile diversity along the 4de1 sequence will help building more focused models .","we offer a broad review of balmer line phenomenology in type 1 active galactic nuclei , briefly summarising luminosity and radio loudness effects , and discussing interpretation in terms of nebular physics along the 4d eigenvector 1 sequence of quasars . we stress that

key open issues and conclusions",How do shifts in quasar spectral lines provide evidence for the expansion of the universe?,Shifts in quasar spectral lines indicate the motion of galaxies and interstellar matter. They provide evidence for cosmic expansion and insights into the universe’s large-scale structure and evolution.," Shifts in quasar spectral lines are a crucial indicator of the expansion of the universe. These lines are emitted by distant quasars as they emit light at various wavelengths. The presence of these lines in our observations allows us to determine the distance to these distant quasars, which is then used to infer the rate of expansion of the universe.
   
   Quasar spectral lines are observed at different wavelengths depending on their distance from Earth. This means that if the universe were expanding, the wavelengths of the emitted light would be changing as the quasars moved away from Earth. By observing the same spectral lines at different times, we can calculate the distance between Earth and the quasars, and thus the rate of expansion of the universe.
   
   Additionally, the fact that quasar spectral lines are observed at different wavelengths also suggests that the universe has been expanding for an extended period of time. If the universe had been expanding for just a few years, the wavelengths of the emitted light would have"," The shifts in quasar spectral lines provide evidence for the expansion of the universe through the Doppler redshift effect. Quasars are distant galaxies that emit light with wavelengths that can be shifted towards the red spectrum when they move away from Earth. This redshift is caused by the recession of the galaxy, which is a result of the expansion of the universe as described by the Big Bang Theory. The more rapid the recession, the greater the redshift. By measuring these redshifts, astronomers can infer the speed at which the universe is expanding, which is consistent with the predictions of the Big Bang Theory. The observed shift in the positions of quasar spectral lines over time provides a clear indication of this expansion, supporting the validity of the cosmological models that predict it. The precision and accuracy of these measurements have improved with advancements in telescope technology and the development of spectroscopy techniques, further validating the reliability of these results as evidence for the universe's expansion.<|im_end|>"
18,138040,"the fast development of experimental techniques makes possible the study of physical properties of samples with sizes of about several nanometers .
the interest in such small objects is due to the appearance of new effects if the size of the system is comparable to some characteristic length . in case of superconductors
it means that the sample should have one size at least of order the coherence length @xmath3 ( such superconductors are called mesoscopic superconductors ) . for example , only for hollow cylinders or rings of radius @xmath4 it is possible to observe the famous little - parks oscillations @xcite .
the majority of the research in this area has been limited to the study of static or quasi - static properties of mesoscopic superconducting rings , disks and other geometries @xcite .
it is surprising that the dynamics in such systems was practically not studied .
however , it knows out that the dynamics is very important for systems which exhibit a series of metastable states and which may be brought far from thermal equilibrium . for such systems the fundamental problem is to determine the final state to which the system will transit too ( see for example ref .
@xcite ) .    in the present work , we present for the first time a detailed study of the dynamic transitions between different states in a mesoscopic superconducting ring . this system is a typical example of the above mentioned systems where a set of metastable states exist .
we will show that the final state depends crucially on the ratio between the relaxation time of the absolute value of the order parameter and the time of change of the phase of the order parameter .
our theoretical results explain the recent magnetization results of pedersen _ et al .
_ @xcite in thin and narrow superconducting @xmath5 rings .
to solve this problem we present a numerical study of the time - dependent ginzburg - landau ( tdgl ) equations .
therefore , our results will also be applicable to other systems ( for example , liquid helium ) where the dynamics are described by these or similar equations . in our approach
we neglect the self - field of the ring ( which is valid if the width and thickness of the ring are less than @xmath6 - the london penetration length ) and hence the distribution of the magnetic field and the vector potential are known functions .
the time - dependent gl equations in this case are    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the order parameter , the vector potential @xmath9 is scaled in units @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 is the quantum of magnetic flux ) , and the coordinates are in units of the coherence length @xmath12 . in these units
the magnetic field is scaled by @xmath13 and the current density , @xmath14 , by @xmath15 .
time is scaled in units of the ginzburg - landau relaxation time @xmath16 , the electrostatic potential , @xmath17 , is in units of @xmath18 ( @xmath19 is the normal - state conductivity ) , and @xmath20 is a relaxation constant . in our numerical calculations we used the new variable @xmath21 which guarantees gauge - invariance of the vector potential on the grid .
we also introduced small white noise @xmath22 in our system , the size of which is much smaller than the barrier height between the metastable states .
we consider @xmath20 as an adjustable parameter which is a measure of the different relaxation times ( for example , the relaxation time of the absolute value of the order parameter ) in the superconductor .
this approach is motivated by the following observations . from an analysis of the general microscopic equations , which are based on the bcs model ,
the relaxation constant @xmath20 was determined in two limiting cases : @xmath23 for dirty gapless superconductors @xcite and @xmath24 for superconductors with weak depairing @xcite . however
, this microscopic theory is built on several assumptions - for example that the electron - electron interaction is of the bcs form , which influences the exact value of @xmath20 .
on the other hand , the stationary and time - dependent ginzburg - landau equations , eqs .
( 1a , b ) , are in some sense more general and their general form does not depend on the specific microscopic model ( but the value of the parameters , of course , are determined by the microscopic theories ) @xcite .
the paper is organized as follows . in sect .
ii we present our numerical results for the solution of eqs .
( 1a , b ) for strictly one - dimensional ring . in sect .
iii we explain the obtained results in terms of different time scales of the mesoscopic superconductor .
the effect of the finite width of the ring is studied in sect .
iv where we also discuss the influence of non - zero temperature and finite @xmath6 .
if the width of the ring is much smaller than @xmath3 and @xmath25 ( @xmath26 is the film thickness ) it is possible to consider the ring , of radius @xmath27 , as a one - dimensional object . at first we limit ourselves to the solution of the strictly one - dimensional eqs .
( 1a , b ) which model the dynamics of a ring with small width . in our approach
the vector potential is equal to @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the applied magnetic field .    ) on the applied magnetic field for different vorticity @xmath30.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    as shown in refs .
@xcite the transition of the superconducting ring from a state with vorticity @xmath31 ( which in general can be a metastable state ) to a state with a different vorticity occurs when the absolute value of the gauge - invariant momentum @xmath32 reaches the critical value @xmath33 let us , for simplicity , consider that the magnetic field is increased from zero ( with initial vorticity of the ring @xmath34 ) to the critical @xmath35 where @xmath36 becomes equal to @xmath37 ( for @xmath34 we have @xmath38 ) . in this case
@xmath39 and we can write eq . ( 2 ) as @xmath40 for this value of the flux the thermodynamical equilibrium state becomes @xmath41 .
for example , if @xmath42 we find @xmath43 ( see fig .
the fundamental question we want to answer is : _ what will be the actual value of the vorticity of the final state _
? will it be the thermodynamic equilibrium state or a metastable one ?
this answer will be obtained from a numerical solution of the time - dependent ginzburg - landau equations .
( b ) and the normal @xmath44 ( c ) current density in the point where the minimal ( thick curves ) and the maximal ( thin curves ) values of the order parameter is reached as function of time for @xmath45 , @xmath42 ( dotted curves ) and @xmath46 ( solid curves ) . for both rings we took @xmath47 , the time interval over which the magnetic field is increased to its value @xmath35 ( inset of fig .
2(a)).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    for our numerical calculations we considered two different rings with radius @xmath42 and @xmath46 .
these values were chosen such that the final state exhibits several metastable states and , in principle , transitions can occur with jumps in @xmath30 which are larger than unity . for @xmath42 , @xmath48 may attain values between 1 and 6 and for @xmath46 it may range from 1 to 9 .
smaller rings have a smaller range of possible @xmath48 values .
we found that larger rings than @xmath46 did not lead to new effects and are therefore not considered here . in our numerical simulations we increased @xmath29 gradually from zero to a value @xmath49 ( we took @xmath50 for @xmath42 and @xmath51 for @xmath46 ) during a time interval @xmath52 ,
after which the magnetic field was kept constant . the magnetic field @xmath53 and time @xmath52 range was chosen sufficiently large in order to speed up the initial time for the nucleation of the phase slip process , but still sufficiently small in order to model real experimental situations in which @xmath29 is increased during a time much larger than @xmath54 ( for example for @xmath5 @xmath55 ) .
a change of @xmath53 and @xmath52 , within realistic boundaries , did not have an influence on our final results .    from our detailed numerical analysis
, we found that the vorticity @xmath30 of the final state of the ring depends on the value of @xmath20 and is not necessary equal to @xmath56 .
the larger @xmath20 the larger the vorticity after the transition .
the final state is reached in the following manner .
when the magnetic field increases the order parameter decreases ( see inset of fig .
2(a ) ) . first , in a single point of the ring a local suppression , in comparison with other points , of the order parameter occurs which deepens gradually with time during the initial part of the development of the instability .
this time scale is taken as the time in which the value of the order parameter decreases from 1 to 0.4 in its minimal point .
when the order parameter reaches the value @xmath57 in its minimal point the process speeds up considerably and the order parameter starts to oscillate in time at this point along the ring ( see fig .
2(a ) ) . at the same time also
oscillatory behavior of the superconducting @xmath58 ( fig .
2(b ) ) and the normal @xmath59 ( fig .
2(c ) ) current density is found at the point where the minimal value of the order parameter is found . at other places in the ring such oscillatory behavior
is strongly damped ( see e.g. the thin curves in fig .
2 ) . after some time
the system evolves to a new stable state , which in the situation of fig
. 2 is @xmath60 for @xmath42 and @xmath61 for @xmath46 .
and for two values of the radius @xmath62 ( dotted curves ) and @xmath63 ( solid curves ) .
the zero of time is taken at the moment when the value of the order parameter becomes equal to @xmath64 in its minimal point .
nonzero values of @xmath65 near the moment of the phase slip is connected with the finite coordinate and time step used in the numerical calculations.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in fig .
3 the dependence on @xmath20 of the dynamics of @xmath65 in the minimal point is illustrated .
note that with increasing value of @xmath20 the number of phase slips ( or equivalently the number of oscillations of the order parameter at its minimal point ) increases and hence @xmath48 also increases .
another important property is that the amplitude of those oscillations decreases with increasing @xmath20 .
the above results lead us to conclude that in a supeconducting ring there are two characteristics time scales .
first , there is the relaxation time of the absolute value of the order parameter @xmath0 .
the second time scale is determined by the time between the phase slips ( ps ) , i.e. the period of oscillation of the value of the order parameter in its minimal point ( see fig .
3 ) . below
we show that the latter time is directly proportional to the time of change of the phase of the order parameter @xmath1 and is connected to the relaxation time of the charge imbalance in the system .    in fig .
4 the distribution of the absolute value of the order parameter @xmath66 and the gauge - invariant momentum @xmath36 are shown near the point where the first phase - slip occurs for a ring with radius @xmath42 and @xmath45 at different times : just before and after the first ps which occurs at @xmath67 . before the moment of the phase
slip the order parameter decreases while after the ps it increases . in order to understand this different behavior
let us rewrite eq .
( 1a ) separately for the absolute value @xmath65 and the phase @xmath68 of the order parameter    @xmath69    here @xmath70 is the arc - coordinate along the ring and we used the condition @xmath71 .
it is obvious from eq .
( 4a ) that if the rhs of eq .
( 4a ) is negative @xmath65 decreases in time and if the rhs is positive @xmath65 will increase in time .
because the second derivative of @xmath65 is always positive ( at least near the phase - slip center - see fig .
4(a ) ) the different time dependence of @xmath65 is governed by the term @xmath72 . from fig .
4(b ) it is clear that after the phase slip the value of @xmath36 is less than before this moment , with practically the same distribution of @xmath65 .
it is this fact which is responsible for an increase of the order parameter just after the moment of the phase slip .
but at some moment of time the momentum @xmath36 can become sufficiently large , making the rhs of eq .
( 4a ) negative and as a consequence @xmath65 starts to decrease .     and with @xmath45 .
the phase slip occurs at @xmath67.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    based on our numerical calculations we may state that for every value of the order parameter in the minimal point , there exists a critical value of the momentum @xmath73 such that if the value of the momentum in this point is less than @xmath73 the order parameter will increase in time . in the opposite case the order parameter decreases which leads ultimately to the phase slip process .
therefore , when after a phase slip @xmath36 increases fast enough such that at some moment the condition @xmath74 is fulfilled , the order parameter will start to decrease which leads than to a new phase slip process .    from our results
we can conclude that the change of @xmath36 ( or phase of the order parameter ) with time and of @xmath65 with time has a different dependence on @xmath20 . indeed from figs . 2 and 3 it follows that with increasing @xmath20 the time relaxation of @xmath65 becomes larger with respect to the relaxation time for @xmath36 ( for example
, the amplitude of oscillations of @xmath65 is decreased ) . moreover
, the relaxation time for @xmath36 depends not only on @xmath20 but also on the history of the system : the larger the number of phase slips which have occurred in the system the longer the time becomes between the next two subsequent phase slips . in order to understand such behavior we turn to eq .
( 4b ) .
the numerical analysis shows that the second term in the rhs of eq .
( 4b ) is only important for some length near the phase slip center .
this length is nothing else than the length over which the electric field penetrates the superconductor .
we checked this directly by solving eqs .
( 1a , b ) for this situation . but
this length is the decay length @xmath75 of the charge imbalance in the superconductor ( see for example refs .
we numerically found that @xmath75 varies with @xmath20 ( in the range @xmath76 ) as @xmath77 .
it means that the relaxation time of the charge imbalance is @xmath78 .
lets take the derivative @xmath79 on both side of eq .
( 4b ) and integrate it over a distance of @xmath75 near the ps center ( far from it we have @xmath80 ) we obtain the josephson relation ( in dimensionless units ) @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the phase difference over the phase slip center which leads to the voltage @xmath83 and where @xmath84 is the normal current ( or electric field in our units ) in the point of the phase slip .
( 5 ) it follows immediately that the relaxation time for the phase of the order parameter near the phase slip center is @xmath85 where @xmath86 means averaging over time between two consecutive phase slips .
this result allows us to qualitatively explain our numerical results . indeed , from fig .
2(c ) it is apparent that @xmath87 decreases after each ps and as a result it leads to an increase of @xmath1 . with increasing @xmath20 ,
@xmath75 decreases and @xmath1 increases . fitting our data
( see fig .
5 ) leads to the dependencies @xmath88 and @xmath89 for rings with radius @xmath42 and @xmath46 , respectively ( here @xmath1 was defined as the time between the first and the second phase slip ) .
this is close to the expected dependencies which follow from eq .
( 6 ) and from the above dependence of @xmath90 ( quantitative differences follows from uncertainty in our finding @xmath1 and @xmath75 ) . besides , eq .
( 6 ) allows us to explain the decrease of @xmath1 with increasing radius of the ring ( see inset in fig .
namely , during the time between two phase slips the gauge - invariant momentum decreases as @xmath91 ( because @xmath92 increases as @xmath93 ) in the system .
far from the phase slip center the total current practically is equal to @xmath94 . because @xmath71 in the ring we directly obtain that during this time the normal current density in the point of the phase slip also decreases as @xmath95 . taking into account eq .
( 6 ) we can conclude that @xmath1 should vary as @xmath95 ( at least for a large radius and for the first phase slip ) . the behavior shown in the inset of fig .
5 is very close to such a dependence ( it is interesting to note that in contrast to @xmath1 the time @xmath0 does practically not depend on @xmath27 ) .    on the basis of our results we can make the following statement : when the period of oscillation ( time of change of the phase of the order parameter ) becomes of the order , or larger , than the relaxation time of the absolute value of the order parameter the next phase slip becomes impossible in the system .
this result can be applied to the system of ref .
@xcite where a current carrying wire was studied .
the authors found a critical current @xmath96 for @xmath24 and @xmath97 for @xmath23 . from our observation
follows that the phase slip solution may be realized as a stable solution when @xmath98 .
we found that @xmath77 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 which leads to the critical current @xmath101 which decreases with increasing @xmath20 @xcite .
above we found that the time scale governing the change in the phase does not coincide with the relaxation time of the absolute value of the order parameter .
this difference is essentially connected with the presence of an electrostatic potential in the system . in order to demonstrate this we performed the following numerical experiment .
we neglected @xmath17 in eq .
( 1a ) and found that the number of ps is now independent of @xmath20 and @xmath27 , and @xmath48 equals unity .
moreover , it turned out that the time scale @xmath102 is an order of magnitude larger .
this clearly shows that the electrostatic potential is responsible for the appearance of a second characteristic time which results in the above mentioned effects .    in an earlier paper @xcite the question of the selection of the metastable state
was already discussed for the case of a superconducting ring . however , these authors neglected the effect of the electrostatic potential and found that transitions with @xmath103 can occur only when the magnetic field ( called the induced electro - moving force ( emf ) in ref .
@xcite ) increases very quickly .
in their case these transitions were connected to the appearance of several nodes in @xmath66 along the perimeter of the ring and in each node a single ps occurred .
we reproduced those results and found such transitions also for larger values of @xmath53 . however , simple estimates show that in order to realize such a situation in practice it is necessary to have an extremely large ramp of the magnetic field .
for example , for @xmath5 mesoscopic samples with @xmath104 and @xmath62 the corresponding ramp should be about @xmath105 .
with such a ramp the induced normal currents in the ring are so large that heating effects will suppress superconductivity .
( curves 1,2 ) , the relaxation time of the order parameter @xmath0 , ( which for definiteness we defined as the time of variation of the order parameter from @xmath64 till the first ps - curves 3,4 ) and the relaxation time of the phase of the order parameter @xmath1 ( we defined it here as the time between the first and second ps - curves 5,6 ) are shown as function of the parameter @xmath20 .
dotted(solid ) curves are for a ring with radius @xmath106 .
dashed curve corresponds to the relaxation time of the charge imbalance ( as obtained from the expression @xmath107 ) . in the inset
, the dependency of @xmath1 on the ring radius is shown for different values of the parameter @xmath20.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    the transitions between the metastable states in the ring are not only determined by @xmath20 and @xmath27 , but also , the presence of defects play a crucial role .
their existence leads to a decrease of @xmath48 .
this is mainly connected to the fact that with decreasing @xmath37 ( as a result of the presence of a defect ) the value of @xmath87 decreases even at the moment of the first phase slip ( because @xmath87 can not be larger than @xmath108 ) and hence @xmath1 increases .
we can also explain this in terms of a decreasing degeneracy of the system .
for example , if we decrease @xmath37 with a factor of two ( e.g. by the presence of defects ) it leads to a twice smaller value for @xmath109 and @xmath56 .
but our numerical analysis showed that the effect of defects is not only restricted to a decrease of @xmath37 and @xmath56 . to show this we simulated a defect by inserting an inclusion of another material with less or zero @xmath110 .
this is done by inserting in the rhs of eq .
( 1a ) an additional term @xmath111 where @xmath112 is zero except inside the defect where @xmath113 .
the magnetic field was increased up to @xmath35 of the ideal ring case .
we found that the number of ps was smaller as compared to the case of a ring without defects .
the calculations was done for defects such that @xmath37 was decreased by less than a factor of 2 in comparison to the ideal ring case .
in contrast , a similar calculation for a ring with nonuniform thickness / width showed that , even for weak nonuniformity ( which decreases @xmath37 by less than @xmath114 ) , @xmath115 was larger than for the ideal ring case and the final vorticity approaches @xmath56 .
this remarkable difference between the situation for a defect and the case of a nonuniformity may be traced back to the difference in the distribution of the order parameter : even in the absence of an external magnetic field the defect leads to a nonuniform distribution of the order parameter which is not so for the nonuniform ring case .
a more thorough study of the effect of defects will be presented elsewhere .
all the above results were based on a one - dimensional model which contains the essential physics of the decay and recovery of the superconducting state in a ring from a metastable state to its final state .
however , even in the case when the effect of the self - field can be neglected the finite width of the ring may still lead to important additional effects ( for example , a finite critical magnetic field ) . in order to include the finite width of the ring into our calculation we considered the following model .
we took a ring of mean radius @xmath116 , width @xmath117 , and thickness less than @xmath3 and @xmath6 .
these parameters are close to those of the ring studied experimentally in ref .
@xcite and they are such that we can still neglect the self - field of the ring .
the obtained magnetization curves of such a ring are shown in fig .
6 as function of the magnetic field and for two values of @xmath20 .
those results were obtained from a numerical solution of the two - dimensional ginzburg - landau equations , eqs .
( 1a , b ) .
the magnetic field was changed with steps @xmath53 over a time interval which is larger than the initial part of the phase slip process @xmath102 ( for our parameters this procedure leads practically to an adiabatic change of the magnetic field ) .    from fig .
6 we notice that the value of the vorticity jumps , @xmath48 , depends sensitively on the parameter @xmath20 @xcite .
we found that the phase slips occur in one particular place along the perimeter of the ring .
however , in contrast to our previous one - dimensional case , @xmath48 depends also on the applied magnetic field .
the reason is that for a finite width ring the number of metastable states decreases with increasing magnetic field ( see ref .
it means that the system can not be moved far from equilibrium with a large superconducting current density ( because the order parameter is strongly suppressed by the external field ) at high magnetic field .
hence , the value of @xmath87 will be much smaller in comparison with the one at low magnetic fields and @xmath1 is larger or comparable with @xmath0 even for high values of @xmath20 and even for the first ps .
thus , the effect of a large magnetic field in case of a finite width ring is similar , to some respect , to the effect of defects for a one - dimensional ring .
our numerical results are in _ qualitative _ agreement with the experimental results of pedersen _ et al . _
( see fig .
@xcite ) . unfortunately ,
no _ quantitative _ comparison is possible because of a number of unknowns , e.g. the value of @xmath37 ( it is necessary to have the dependence of @xmath118 as obtained starting from zero magnetic field ) , the value of @xmath3 is not accurately known and hence the ratio @xmath119 can therefore only be estimated .
the value of both these parameters have a strong influence on the value of the vorticity jumps @xmath48 .    .
the results are shown for a sweep up and sweep down of the magnetic field.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    let us discuss now finite temperature and screening effects ( i.e. finite @xmath6 ) .
nonzero temperature leads to the possibility of a perturbative appearance of phase slip centers at @xmath120 .
but if the field @xmath121 does not differ too much from @xmath35 the average @xmath87 is not altered strongly . as a result , after the appearance of the first thermo - activated ps center the second phase slip may appear automatically ( if the ratio @xmath2 is large enough ) which leads to an avalanche - type of process .
unfortunately , it is impossible to apply the results of ref .
@xcite in order to calculate the probability of this process even for the first ps .
the reason is that in ref .
@xcite the effect of the electrostatic potential ( which play a crucial role as was mentioned above ) was neglected .
a finite @xmath6 ( and large enough width of the ring ) leads to a nonuniform distribution of the momentum @xmath36 over the width of the ring which can play an important role on the above considered effects .
as we mentioned above such a finite width ring may be modelled as a strip with transport current in an external magnetic field . in ref .
@xcite the condition for the entry of the first vortices in a narrow superconducting strip was studied .
it turned out , that the period of vortex chain entry depends essentially on the distribution of @xmath36 over the width of the strip .
when this distribution is uniform the period is infinite .
but even small nonuniformities in this distribution leads to a finite period .
if we translate their results to our ring geometry , the period of the vortex chain must now be discrete @xmath122 ( @xmath123 ) . under a certain condition
the entry of vortices becomes possible , not through a single point along the perimeter , but through two , three and more points ( without increasing the ramp of the magnetic field ) .
a finite @xmath6 only increases this effect because it leads to larger nonuniformities in the dependence of @xmath36 over the ring width .
in this situation there is a competition between the process of the appearance of additional nodes along the ring perimeter and the number of ps in these points . at high magnetic fields
these effects becomes negligible small ( because superconductivity only exists near the edges and the ring effectively can be considered as two one - dimensional rings ) and we will have the situation as discussed in the present work , and , recently in @xcite .
in conclusion , we studied how an unstable superconducting state of a superconducting ring evolves in time and transit to its final state .
the latter is not necessary the thermodynamic equilibrium state and may be another metastable state with a different vorticity but which is stable in time .
the transition between the different superconducting states occurs through a phase slip center which is a point along the ring where the superconducting amplitude decreases to zero abruptly resulting in the change of the vorticity of the superconducting state with one unit .
the waiting time , or the creation time for the first phase slip , is found to be two orders of magnitude larger than the subsequent time intervals between consecutive phase slips .
the latter time is connected with the time relaxation of the charge imbalance in the superconductor and increases the closer the system becomes to the final state .
this circumstance allows to find this time ( also as the relaxation time of the absolute value of the order parameter ) from magnetic measurements of superconducting rings of large radius .
our theoretical findings are in agreement with recent experimental results of pedersen _ et al .

conclusion",What factors influence the stability of superconducting currents in magnetic field environments?,Superconducting currents are stabilized by minimizing magnetic flux disturbances. Factors like material properties and external magnetic field variations play a crucial role in maintaining current stability.," The stability of superconducting currents in magnetic field environments can be influenced by several factors. These include the magnetic field strength, the duration of the magnetic field, the presence of magnetic impurities, the geometry of the sample, and the presence of other electromagnetic fields. Additionally, the temperature of the superconducting material can play a role in determining its stability under magnetic fields. Overall, the stability of superconducting currents is generally affected by the balance between the magnetic field strength and the resistance of the superconducting material, as well as the presence of other electromagnetic fields that can interfere with the superconducting state. However, the exact relationship between these factors and the stability of superconducting currents is still not fully understood and can vary depending on the specific conditions and materials involved.<|im_end|>"," The factors that influence the stability of superconducting currents in magnetic field environments include the presence of a magnetic field, which can induce a magnetic moment in the electrons, and the nature of the material. In materials with a strong magnetic moment, such as iron-based superconductors, the magnetic field can cause the electrons to become more aligned, which can reduce the probability of the electrons colliding with each other and leading to improved superconductivity. Additionally, the magnetic field can also induce a magnetic field gradient, which can further stabilize the superconducting current. However, if the magnetic field is too strong, it can also cause the electrons to lose their alignment, which can reduce the superconductivity. Therefore, the stability of superconducting currents in magnetic field environments depends on the strength and nature of the magnetic field and the material. Furthermore, the magnetic field can also affect the thermal properties of the superconducting material, which can further influence its stability. Overall, the stability of superconduct"
